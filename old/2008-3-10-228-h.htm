<P CLASS="poem">
Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate,<BR>
And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate,<BR>
Expell'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore.<BR>
Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore,<BR>
And in the doubtful war, before he won<BR>
The Latian realm, and built the destin'd town;<BR>
His banish'd gods restor'd to rites divine,<BR>
And settled sure succession in his line,<BR>
From whence the race of Alban fathers come,<BR>
And the long glories of majestic Rome.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate;<BR>
What goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate;<BR>
For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began<BR>
To persecute so brave, so just a man;<BR>
Involv'd his anxious life in endless cares,<BR>
Expos'd to wants, and hurried into wars!<BR>
Can heav'nly minds such high resentment show,<BR>
Or exercise their spite in human woe?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Against the Tiber's mouth, but far away,<BR>
An ancient town was seated on the sea;<BR>
A Tyrian colony; the people made<BR>
Stout for the war, and studious of their trade:<BR>
Carthage the name; belov'd by Juno more<BR>
Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore.<BR>
Here stood her chariot; here, if Heav'n were kind,<BR>
The seat of awful empire she design'd.<BR>
Yet she had heard an ancient rumor fly,<BR>
(Long cited by the people of the sky,)<BR>
That times to come should see the Trojan race<BR>
Her Carthage ruin, and her tow'rs deface;<BR>
Nor thus confin'd, the yoke of sov'reign sway<BR>
Should on the necks of all the nations lay.<BR>
She ponder'd this, and fear'd it was in fate;<BR>
Nor could forget the war she wag'd of late<BR>
For conqu'ring Greece against the Trojan state.<BR>
Besides, long causes working in her mind,<BR>
And secret seeds of envy, lay behind;<BR>
Deep graven in her heart the doom remain'd<BR>
Of partial Paris, and her form disdain'd;<BR>
The grace bestow'd on ravish'd Ganymed,<BR>
Electra's glories, and her injur'd bed.<BR>
Each was a cause alone; and all combin'd<BR>
To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind.<BR>
For this, far distant from the Latian coast<BR>
She drove the remnants of the Trojan host;<BR>
And sev'n long years th' unhappy wand'ring train<BR>
Were toss'd by storms, and scatter'd thro' the main.<BR>
Such time, such toil, requir'd the Roman name,<BR>
Such length of labor for so vast a frame.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now scarce the Trojan fleet, with sails and oars,<BR>
Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores,<BR>
Ent'ring with cheerful shouts the wat'ry reign,<BR>
And plowing frothy furrows in the main;<BR>
When, lab'ring still with endless discontent,<BR>
The Queen of Heav'n did thus her fury vent:<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Then am I vanquish'd? must I yield?" said she,<BR>
"And must the Trojans reign in Italy?<BR>
So Fate will have it, and Jove adds his force;<BR>
Nor can my pow'r divert their happy course.<BR>
Could angry Pallas, with revengeful spleen,<BR>
The Grecian navy burn, and drown the men?<BR>
She, for the fault of one offending foe,<BR>
The bolts of Jove himself presum'd to throw:<BR>
With whirlwinds from beneath she toss'd the ship,<BR>
And bare expos'd the bosom of the deep;<BR>
Then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game,<BR>
The wretch, yet hissing with her father's flame,<BR>
She strongly seiz'd, and with a burning wound<BR>
Transfix'd, and naked, on a rock she bound.<BR>
But I, who walk in awful state above,<BR>
The majesty of heav'n, the sister wife of Jove,<BR>
For length of years my fruitless force employ<BR>
Against the thin remains of ruin'd Troy!<BR>
What nations now to Juno's pow'r will pray,<BR>
Or off'rings on my slighted altars lay?"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thus rag'd the goddess; and, with fury fraught.<BR>
The restless regions of the storms she sought,<BR>
Where, in a spacious cave of living stone,<BR>
The tyrant Aeolus, from his airy throne,<BR>
With pow'r imperial curbs the struggling winds,<BR>
And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds.<BR>
This way and that th' impatient captives tend,<BR>
And, pressing for release, the mountains rend.<BR>
High in his hall th' undaunted monarch stands,<BR>
And shakes his scepter, and their rage commands;<BR>
Which did he not, their unresisted sway<BR>
Would sweep the world before them in their way;<BR>
Earth, air, and seas thro' empty space would roll,<BR>
And heav'n would fly before the driving soul.<BR>
In fear of this, the Father of the Gods<BR>
Confin'd their fury to those dark abodes,<BR>
And lock'd 'em safe within, oppress'd with mountain loads;<BR>
Impos'd a king, with arbitrary sway,<BR>
To loose their fetters, or their force allay.<BR>
To whom the suppliant queen her pray'rs address'd,<BR>
And thus the tenor of her suit express'd:<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"O Aeolus! for to thee the King of Heav'n<BR>
The pow'r of tempests and of winds has giv'n;<BR>
Thy force alone their fury can restrain,<BR>
And smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main-<BR>
A race of wand'ring slaves, abhorr'd by me,<BR>
With prosp'rous passage cut the Tuscan sea;<BR>
To fruitful Italy their course they steer,<BR>
And for their vanquish'd gods design new temples there.<BR>
Raise all thy winds; with night involve the skies;<BR>
Sink or disperse my fatal enemies.<BR>
Twice sev'n, the charming daughters of the main,<BR>
Around my person wait, and bear my train:<BR>
Succeed my wish, and second my design;<BR>
The fairest, Deiopeia, shall be thine,<BR>
And make thee father of a happy line."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
To this the god: "'T is yours, O queen, to will<BR>
The work which duty binds me to fulfil.<BR>
These airy kingdoms, and this wide command,<BR>
Are all the presents of your bounteous hand:<BR>
Yours is my sov'reign's grace; and, as your guest,<BR>
I sit with gods at their celestial feast;<BR>
Raise tempests at your pleasure, or subdue;<BR>
Dispose of empire, which I hold from you."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He said, and hurl'd against the mountain side<BR>
His quiv'ring spear, and all the god applied.<BR>
The raging winds rush thro' the hollow wound,<BR>
And dance aloft in air, and skim along the ground;<BR>
Then, settling on the sea, the surges sweep,<BR>
Raise liquid mountains, and disclose the deep.<BR>
South, East, and West with mix'd confusion roar,<BR>
And roll the foaming billows to the shore.<BR>
The cables crack; the sailors' fearful cries<BR>
Ascend; and sable night involves the skies;<BR>
And heav'n itself is ravish'd from their eyes.<BR>
Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue;<BR>
Then flashing fires the transient light renew;<BR>
The face of things a frightful image bears,<BR>
And present death in various forms appears.<BR>
Struck with unusual fright, the Trojan chief,<BR>
With lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief;<BR>
And, "Thrice and four times happy those," he cried,<BR>
"That under Ilian walls before their parents died!<BR>
Tydides, bravest of the Grecian train!<BR>
Why could not I by that strong arm be slain,<BR>
And lie by noble Hector on the plain,<BR>
Or great Sarpedon, in those bloody fields<BR>
Where Simois rolls the bodies and the shields<BR>
Of heroes, whose dismember'd hands yet bear<BR>
The dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear!"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails,<BR>
Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails,<BR>
And rent the sheets; the raging billows rise,<BR>
And mount the tossing vessels to the skies:<BR>
Nor can the shiv'ring oars sustain the blow;<BR>
The galley gives her side, and turns her prow;<BR>
While those astern, descending down the steep,<BR>
Thro' gaping waves behold the boiling deep.<BR>
Three ships were hurried by the southern blast,<BR>
And on the secret shelves with fury cast.<BR>
Those hidden rocks th' Ausonian sailors knew:<BR>
They call'd them Altars, when they rose in view,<BR>
And show'd their spacious backs above the flood.<BR>
Three more fierce Eurus, in his angry mood,<BR>
Dash'd on the shallows of the moving sand,<BR>
And in mid ocean left them moor'd aland.<BR>
Orontes' bark, that bore the Lycian crew,<BR>
(A horrid sight!) ev'n in the hero's view,<BR>
From stem to stern by waves was overborne:<BR>
The trembling pilot, from his rudder torn,<BR>
Was headlong hurl'd; thrice round the ship was toss'd,<BR>
Then bulg'd at once, and in the deep was lost;<BR>
And here and there above the waves were seen<BR>
Arms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men.<BR>
The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way,<BR>
And suck'd thro' loosen'd planks the rushing sea.<BR>
Ilioneus was her chief: Alethes old,<BR>
Achates faithful, Abas young and bold,<BR>
Endur'd not less; their ships, with gaping seams,<BR>
Admit the deluge of the briny streams.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Meantime imperial Neptune heard the sound<BR>
Of raging billows breaking on the ground.<BR>
Displeas'd, and fearing for his wat'ry reign,<BR>
He rear'd his awful head above the main,<BR>
Serene in majesty; then roll'd his eyes<BR>
Around the space of earth, and seas, and skies.<BR>
He saw the Trojan fleet dispers'd, distress'd,<BR>
By stormy winds and wintry heav'n oppress'd.<BR>
Full well the god his sister's envy knew,<BR>
And what her aims and what her arts pursue.<BR>
He summon'd Eurus and the western blast,<BR>
And first an angry glance on both he cast;<BR>
Then thus rebuk'd: "Audacious winds! from whence<BR>
This bold attempt, this rebel insolence?<BR>
Is it for you to ravage seas and land,<BR>
Unauthoriz'd by my supreme command?<BR>
To raise such mountains on the troubled main?<BR>
Whom I- but first 't is fit the billows to restrain;<BR>
And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign.<BR>
Hence! to your lord my royal mandate bear-<BR>
The realms of ocean and the fields of air<BR>
Are mine, not his. By fatal lot to me<BR>
The liquid empire fell, and trident of the sea.<BR>
His pow'r to hollow caverns is confin'd:<BR>
There let him reign, the jailer of the wind,<BR>
With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call,<BR>
And boast and bluster in his empty hall."<BR>
He spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth'd the sea,<BR>
Dispell'd the darkness, and restor'd the day.<BR>
Cymothoe, Triton, and the sea-green train<BR>
Of beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main,<BR>
Clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands:<BR>
The god himself with ready trident stands,<BR>
And opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands;<BR>
Then heaves them off the shoals. Where'er he guides<BR>
His finny coursers and in triumph rides,<BR>
The waves unruffle and the sea subsides.<BR>
As, when in tumults rise th' ignoble crowd,<BR>
Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud;<BR>
And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly,<BR>
And all the rustic arms that fury can supply:<BR>
If then some grave and pious man appear,<BR>
They hush their noise, and lend a list'ning ear;<BR>
He soothes with sober words their angry mood,<BR>
And quenches their innate desire of blood:<BR>
So, when the Father of the Flood appears,<BR>
And o'er the seas his sov'reign trident rears,<BR>
Their fury falls: he skims the liquid plains,<BR>
High on his chariot, and, with loosen'd reins,<BR>
Majestic moves along, and awful peace maintains.<BR>
The weary Trojans ply their shatter'd oars<BR>
To nearest land, and make the Libyan shores.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Within a long recess there lies a bay:<BR>
An island shades it from the rolling sea,<BR>
And forms a port secure for ships to ride;<BR>
Broke by the jutting land, on either side,<BR>
In double streams the briny waters glide.<BR>
Betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene<BR>
Appears above, and groves for ever green:<BR>
A grot is form'd beneath, with mossy seats,<BR>
To rest the Nereids, and exclude the heats.<BR>
Down thro' the crannies of the living walls<BR>
The crystal streams descend in murm'ring falls:<BR>
No haulsers need to bind the vessels here,<BR>
Nor bearded anchors; for no storms they fear.<BR>
Sev'n ships within this happy harbor meet,<BR>
The thin remainders of the scatter'd fleet.<BR>
The Trojans, worn with toils, and spent with woes,<BR>
Leap on the welcome land, and seek their wish'd repose.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
First, good Achates, with repeated strokes<BR>
Of clashing flints, their hidden fire provokes:<BR>
Short flame succeeds; a bed of wither'd leaves<BR>
The dying sparkles in their fall receives:<BR>
Caught into life, in fiery fumes they rise,<BR>
And, fed with stronger food, invade the skies.<BR>
The Trojans, dropping wet, or stand around<BR>
The cheerful blaze, or lie along the ground:<BR>
Some dry their corn, infected with the brine,<BR>
Then grind with marbles, and prepare to dine.<BR>
Aeneas climbs the mountain's airy brow,<BR>
And takes a prospect of the seas below,<BR>
If Capys thence, or Antheus he could spy,<BR>
Or see the streamers of Caicus fly.<BR>
No vessels were in view; but, on the plain,<BR>
Three beamy stags command a lordly train<BR>
Of branching heads: the more ignoble throng<BR>
Attend their stately steps, and slowly graze along.<BR>
He stood; and, while secure they fed below,<BR>
He took the quiver and the trusty bow<BR>
Achates us'd to bear: the leaders first<BR>
He laid along, and then the vulgar pierc'd;<BR>
Nor ceas'd his arrows, till the shady plain<BR>
Sev'n mighty bodies with their blood distain.<BR>
For the sev'n ships he made an equal share,<BR>
And to the port return'd, triumphant from the war.<BR>
The jars of gen'rous wine (Acestes' gift,<BR>
When his Trinacrian shores the navy left)<BR>
He set abroach, and for the feast prepar'd,<BR>
In equal portions with the ven'son shar'd.<BR>
Thus while he dealt it round, the pious chief<BR>
With cheerful words allay'd the common grief:<BR>
"Endure, and conquer! Jove will soon dispose<BR>
To future good our past and present woes.<BR>
With me, the rocks of Scylla you have tried;<BR>
Th' inhuman Cyclops and his den defied.<BR>
What greater ills hereafter can you bear?<BR>
Resume your courage and dismiss your care,<BR>
An hour will come, with pleasure to relate<BR>
Your sorrows past, as benefits of Fate.<BR>
Thro' various hazards and events, we move<BR>
To Latium and the realms foredoom'd by Jove.<BR>
Call'd to the seat (the promise of the skies)<BR>
Where Trojan kingdoms once again may rise,<BR>
Endure the hardships of your present state;<BR>
Live, and reserve yourselves for better fate."<BR>

These words he spoke, but spoke not from his heart;<BR>
His outward smiles conceal'd his inward smart.<BR>
The jolly crew, unmindful of the past,<BR>
The quarry share, their plenteous dinner haste.<BR>
Some strip the skin; some portion out the spoil;<BR>
The limbs, yet trembling, in the caldrons boil;<BR>
Some on the fire the reeking entrails broil.<BR>
Stretch'd on the grassy turf, at ease they dine,<BR>
Restore their strength with meat, and cheer their souls with<BR>
wine.<BR>
Their hunger thus appeas'd, their care attends<BR>
The doubtful fortune of their absent friends:<BR>
Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess,<BR>
Whether to deem 'em dead, or in distress.<BR>

Of brave Orontes, and th' uncertain state<BR>
Of Gyas, Lycus, and of Amycus.<BR>
The day, but not their sorrows, ended thus.<BR>

Meantime, in shades of night Aeneas lies:<BR>
Care seiz'd his soul, and sleep forsook his eyes.<BR>
But, when the sun restor'd the cheerful day,<BR>
He rose, the coast and country to survey,<BR>
Anxious and eager to discover more.<BR>
It look'd a wild uncultivated shore;<BR>
But, whether humankind, or beasts alone<BR>
Possess'd the new-found region, was unknown.<BR>
Beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides:<BR>
Tall trees surround the mountain's shady sides;<BR>
The bending brow above a safe retreat provides.<BR>
Arm'd with two pointed darts, he leaves his friends,<BR>
And true Achates on his steps attends.<BR>
Lo! in the deep recesses of the wood,<BR>
Before his eyes his goddess mother stood:<BR>
A huntress in her habit and her mien;<BR>
Her dress a maid, her air confess'd a queen.<BR>
Bare were her knees, and knots her garments bind;<BR>
Loose was her hair, and wanton'd in the wind;<BR>
Her hand sustain'd a bow; her quiver hung behind.<BR>
She seem'd a virgin of the Spartan blood:<BR>
With such array Harpalyce bestrode<BR>
Her Thracian courser and outstripp'd the rapid flood.<BR>
"Ho, strangers! have you lately seen," she said,<BR>
"One of my sisters, like myself array'd,<BR>
Who cross'd the lawn, or in the forest stray'd?<BR>
A painted quiver at her back she bore;<BR>
Varied with spots, a lynx's hide she wore;<BR>
And at full cry pursued the tusky boar."<BR>

Thus Venus: thus her son replied again:<BR>
"None of your sisters have we heard or seen,<BR>
O virgin! or what other name you bear<BR>
Above that style- O more than mortal fair!<BR>
Your voice and mien celestial birth betray!<BR>
If, as you seem, the sister of the day,<BR>
Or one at least of chaste Diana's train,<BR>
Let not an humble suppliant sue in vain;<BR>
But tell a stranger, long in tempests toss'd,<BR>
What earth we tread, and who commands the coast?<BR>
Then on your name shall wretched mortals call,<BR>
And offer'd victims at your altars fall."<BR>
"I dare not," she replied, "assume the name<BR>
Of goddess, or celestial honors claim:<BR>
For Tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear,<BR>
And purple buskins o'er their ankles wear.<BR>
Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are-<BR>
A people rude in peace, and rough in war.<BR>
The rising city, which from far you see,<BR>
Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony.<BR>
Phoenician Dido rules the growing state,<BR>
Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother's hate.<BR>
Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate;<BR>
Which I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known<BR>
For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne,<BR>
Possess'd fair Dido's bed; and either heart<BR>
At once was wounded with an equal dart.<BR>
Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid;<BR>
Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway'd:<BR>
One who condemn'd divine and human laws.<BR>
Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause.<BR>
The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth,<BR>
With steel invades his brother's life by stealth;<BR>
Before the sacred altar made him bleed,<BR>
And long from her conceal'd the cruel deed.<BR>
Some tale, some new pretense, he daily coin'd,<BR>
To soothe his sister, and delude her mind.<BR>
At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears<BR>
Of her unhappy lord: the specter stares,<BR>
And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares.<BR>
The cruel altars and his fate he tells,<BR>
And the dire secret of his house reveals,<BR>
Then warns the widow, with her household gods,<BR>
To seek a refuge in remote abodes.<BR>
Last, to support her in so long a way,<BR>
He shows her where his hidden treasure lay.<BR>
Admonish'd thus, and seiz'd with mortal fright,<BR>
The queen provides companions of her flight:<BR>
They meet, and all combine to leave the state,<BR>
Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate.<BR>
They seize a fleet, which ready rigg'd they find;<BR>
Nor is Pygmalion's treasure left behind.<BR>
The vessels, heavy laden, put to sea<BR>
With prosp'rous winds; a woman leads the way.<BR>
I know not, if by stress of weather driv'n,<BR>
Or was their fatal course dispos'd by Heav'n;<BR>
At last they landed, where from far your eyes<BR>
May view the turrets of new Carthage rise;<BR>
There bought a space of ground, which (Byrsa call'd,<BR>
From the bull's hide) they first inclos'd, and wall'd.<BR>
But whence are you? what country claims your birth?<BR>
What seek you, strangers, on our Libyan earth?"<BR>

To whom, with sorrow streaming from his eyes,<BR>
And deeply sighing, thus her son replies:<BR>
"Could you with patience hear, or I relate,<BR>
O nymph, the tedious annals of our fate!<BR>
Thro' such a train of woes if I should run,<BR>
The day would sooner than the tale be done!<BR>
From ancient Troy, by force expell'd, we came-<BR>
If you by chance have heard the Trojan name.<BR>
On various seas by various tempests toss'd,<BR>
At length we landed on your Libyan coast.<BR>
The good Aeneas am I call'd- a name,<BR>
While Fortune favor'd, not unknown to fame.<BR>
My household gods, companions of my woes,<BR>
With pious care I rescued from our foes.<BR>
To fruitful Italy my course was bent;<BR>
And from the King of Heav'n is my descent.<BR>
With twice ten sail I cross'd the Phrygian sea;<BR>
Fate and my mother goddess led my way.<BR>
Scarce sev'n, the thin remainders of my fleet,<BR>
From storms preserv'd, within your harbor meet.<BR>
Myself distress'd, an exile, and unknown,<BR>
Debarr'd from Europe, and from Asia thrown,<BR>
In Libyan desarts wander thus alone."<BR>

His tender parent could no longer bear;<BR>
But, interposing, sought to soothe his care.<BR>
"Whoe'er you are- not unbelov'd by Heav'n,<BR>
Since on our friendly shore your ships are driv'n-<BR>
Have courage: to the gods permit the rest,<BR>
And to the queen expose your just request.<BR>
Now take this earnest of success, for more:<BR>
Your scatter'd fleet is join'd upon the shore;<BR>
The winds are chang'd, your friends from danger free;<BR>
Or I renounce my skill in augury.<BR>
Twelve swans behold in beauteous order move,<BR>
And stoop with closing pinions from above;<BR>
Whom late the bird of Jove had driv'n along,<BR>
And thro' the clouds pursued the scatt'ring throng:<BR>
Now, all united in a goodly team,<BR>
They skim the ground, and seek the quiet stream.<BR>
As they, with joy returning, clap their wings,<BR>
And ride the circuit of the skies in rings;<BR>
Not otherwise your ships, and ev'ry friend,<BR>
Already hold the port, or with swift sails descend.<BR>
No more advice is needful; but pursue<BR>
The path before you, and the town in view."<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thus having said, she turn'd, and made appear<BR>
Her neck refulgent, and dishevel'd hair,<BR>
Which, flowing from her shoulders, reach'd the ground.<BR>
And widely spread ambrosial scents around:<BR>
In length of train descends her sweeping gown;<BR>
And, by her graceful walk, the Queen of Love is known.<BR>
The prince pursued the parting deity<BR>
With words like these: "Ah! whither do you fly?<BR>
Unkind and cruel! to deceive your son<BR>
In borrow'd shapes, and his embrace to shun;<BR>
Never to bless my sight, but thus unknown;<BR>
And still to speak in accents not your own."<BR>
Against the goddess these complaints he made,<BR>
But took the path, and her commands obey'd.<BR>
They march, obscure; for Venus kindly shrouds<BR>
With mists their persons, and involves in clouds,<BR>
That, thus unseen, their passage none might stay,<BR>
Or force to tell the causes of their way.<BR>
This part perform'd, the goddess flies sublime<BR>
To visit Paphos and her native clime;<BR>
Where garlands, ever green and ever fair,<BR>
With vows are offer'd, and with solemn pray'r:<BR>
A hundred altars in her temple smoke;<BR>
A thousand bleeding hearts her pow'r invoke.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
They climb the next ascent, and, looking down,<BR>
Now at a nearer distance view the town.<BR>
The prince with wonder sees the stately tow'rs,<BR>
Which late were huts and shepherds' homely bow'rs,<BR>
The gates and streets; and hears, from ev'ry part,<BR>
The noise and busy concourse of the mart.<BR>
The toiling Tyrians on each other call<BR>
To ply their labor: some extend the wall;<BR>
Some build the citadel; the brawny throng<BR>
Or dig, or push unwieldly stones along.<BR>
Some for their dwellings choose a spot of ground,<BR>
Which, first design'd, with ditches they surround.<BR>
Some laws ordain; and some attend the choice<BR>
Of holy senates, and elect by voice.<BR>
Here some design a mole, while others there<BR>
Lay deep foundations for a theater;<BR>
From marble quarries mighty columns hew,<BR>
For ornaments of scenes, and future view.<BR>
Such is their toil, and such their busy pains,<BR>
As exercise the bees in flow'ry plains,<BR>
When winter past, and summer scarce begun,<BR>
Invites them forth to labor in the sun;<BR>
Some lead their youth abroad, while some condense<BR>
Their liquid store, and some in cells dispense;<BR>
Some at the gate stand ready to receive<BR>
The golden burthen, and their friends relieve;<BR>
All with united force, combine to drive<BR>
The lazy drones from the laborious hive:<BR>
With envy stung, they view each other's deeds;<BR>
The fragrant work with diligence proceeds.<BR>
"Thrice happy you, whose walls already rise!"<BR>
Aeneas said, and view'd, with lifted eyes,<BR>
Their lofty tow'rs; then, entiring at the gate,<BR>
Conceal'd in clouds (prodigious to relate)<BR>
He mix'd, unmark'd, among the busy throng,<BR>
Borne by the tide, and pass'd unseen along.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Full in the center of the town there stood,<BR>
Thick set with trees, a venerable wood.<BR>
The Tyrians, landing near this holy ground,<BR>
And digging here, a prosp'rous omen found:<BR>
From under earth a courser's head they drew,<BR>
Their growth and future fortune to foreshew.<BR>
This fated sign their foundress Juno gave,<BR>
Of a soil fruitful, and a people brave.<BR>
Sidonian Dido here with solemn state<BR>
Did Juno's temple build, and consecrate,<BR>
Enrich'd with gifts, and with a golden shrine;<BR>
But more the goddess made the place divine.<BR>
On brazen steps the marble threshold rose,<BR>
And brazen plates the cedar beams inclose:<BR>
The rafters are with brazen cov'rings crown'd;<BR>
The lofty doors on brazen hinges sound.<BR>
What first Aeneas this place beheld,<BR>
Reviv'd his courage, and his fear expell'd.<BR>
For while, expecting there the queen, he rais'd<BR>
His wond'ring eyes, and round the temple gaz'd,<BR>
Admir'd the fortune of the rising town,<BR>
The striving artists, and their arts' renown;<BR>
He saw, in order painted on the wall,<BR>
Whatever did unhappy Troy befall:<BR>
The wars that fame around the world had blown,<BR>
All to the life, and ev'ry leader known.<BR>
There Agamemnon, Priam here, he spies,<BR>
And fierce Achilles, who both kings defies.<BR>
He stopp'd, and weeping said: "O friend! ev'n here<BR>
The monuments of Trojan woes appear!<BR>
Our known disasters fill ev'n foreign lands:<BR>
See there, where old unhappy Priam stands!<BR>
Ev'n the mute walls relate the warrior's fame,<BR>
And Trojan griefs the Tyrians' pity claim."<BR>
He said (his tears a ready passage find),<BR>
Devouring what he saw so well design'd,<BR>
And with an empty picture fed his mind:<BR>
For there he saw the fainting Grecians yield,<BR>
And here the trembling Trojans quit the field,<BR>
Pursued by fierce Achilles thro' the plain,<BR>
On his high chariot driving o'er the slain.<BR>
The tents of Rhesus next his grief renew,<BR>
By their white sails betray'd to nightly view;<BR>
And wakeful Diomede, whose cruel sword<BR>
The sentries slew, nor spar'd their slumb'ring lord,<BR>
Then took the fiery steeds, ere yet the food<BR>
Of Troy they taste, or drink the Xanthian flood.<BR>
Elsewhere he saw where Troilus defied<BR>
Achilles, and unequal combat tried;<BR>
Then, where the boy disarm'd, with loosen'd reins,<BR>
Was by his horses hurried o'er the plains,<BR>
Hung by the neck and hair, and dragg'd around:<BR>
The hostile spear, yet sticking in his wound,<BR>
With tracks of blood inscrib'd the dusty ground.<BR>
Meantime the Trojan dames, oppress'd with woe,<BR>
To Pallas' fane in long procession go,<BR>
In hopes to reconcile their heav'nly foe.<BR>
They weep, they beat their breasts, they rend their hair,<BR>
And rich embroider'd vests for presents bear;<BR>
But the stern goddess stands unmov'd with pray'r.<BR>
Thrice round the Trojan walls Achilles drew<BR>
The corpse of Hector, whom in fight he slew.<BR>
Here Priam sues; and there, for sums of gold,<BR>
The lifeless body of his son is sold.<BR>
So sad an object, and so well express'd,<BR>
Drew sighs and groans from the griev'd hero's breast,<BR>
To see the figure of his lifeless friend,<BR>
And his old sire his helpless hand extend.<BR>
Himself he saw amidst the Grecian train,<BR>
Mix'd in the bloody battle on the plain;<BR>
And swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew,<BR>
His pompous ensigns, and his Indian crew.<BR>
Penthisilea there, with haughty grace,<BR>
Leads to the wars an Amazonian race:<BR>
In their right hands a pointed dart they wield;<BR>
The left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield.<BR>
Athwart her breast a golden belt she throws,<BR>
Amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes,<BR>
And dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose.<BR>

Thus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes,<BR>
Fix'd on the walls with wonder and surprise,<BR>
The beauteous Dido, with a num'rous train<BR>
And pomp of guards, ascends the sacred fane.<BR>
Such on Eurotas' banks, or Cynthus' height,<BR>
Diana seems; and so she charms the sight,<BR>
When in the dance the graceful goddess leads<BR>
The choir of nymphs, and overtops their heads:<BR>
Known by her quiver, and her lofty mien,<BR>
She walks majestic, and she looks their queen;<BR>
Latona sees her shine above the rest,<BR>
And feeds with secret joy her silent breast.<BR>
Such Dido was; with such becoming state,<BR>
Amidst the crowd, she walks serenely great.<BR>
Their labor to her future sway she speeds,<BR>
And passing with a gracious glance proceeds;<BR>
Then mounts the throne, high plac'd before the shrine:<BR>
In crowds around, the swarming people join.<BR>
She takes petitions, and dispenses laws,<BR>
Hears and determines ev'ry private cause;<BR>
Their tasks in equal portions she divides,<BR>
And, where unequal, there by lots decides.<BR>
Another way by chance Aeneas bends<BR>
His eyes, and unexpected sees his friends,<BR>
Antheus, Sergestus grave, Cloanthus strong,<BR>
And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng,<BR>
Whom late the tempest on the billows toss'd,<BR>
And widely scatter'd on another coast.<BR>
The prince, unseen, surpris'd with wonder stands,<BR>
And longs, with joyful haste, to join their hands;<BR>
But, doubtful of the wish'd event, he stays,<BR>
And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys,<BR>
Impatient till they told their present state,<BR>
And where they left their ships, and what their fate,<BR>
And why they came, and what was their request;<BR>
For these were sent, commission'd by the rest,<BR>
To sue for leave to land their sickly men,<BR>
And gain admission to the gracious queen.<BR>
Ent'ring, with cries they fill'd the holy fane;<BR>
Then thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began:<BR>

From sea to sea, thy clemency implore.<BR>
Forbid the fires our shipping to deface!<BR>
Receive th' unhappy fugitives to grace,<BR>
And spare the remnant of a pious race!<BR>
We come not with design of wasteful prey,<BR>
To drive the country, force the swains away:<BR>
Nor such our strength, nor such is our desire;<BR>
The vanquish'd dare not to such thoughts aspire.<BR>
A land there is, Hesperia nam'd of old;<BR>
The soil is fruitful, and the men are bold-<BR>
Th' Oenotrians held it once- by common fame<BR>
Now call'd Italia, from the leader's name.<BR>
To that sweet region was our voyage bent,<BR>
When winds and ev'ry warring element<BR>
Disturb'd our course, and, far from sight of land,<BR>
Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand:<BR>
The sea came on; the South, with mighty roar,<BR>
Dispers'd and dash'd the rest upon the rocky shore.<BR>
Those few you see escap'd the Storm, and fear,<BR>
Unless you interpose, a shipwreck here.<BR>
What men, what monsters, what inhuman race,<BR>
What laws, what barb'rous customs of the place,<BR>
Shut up a desart shore to drowning men,<BR>
And drive us to the cruel seas again?<BR>
If our hard fortune no compassion draws,<BR>
Nor hospitable rights, nor human laws,<BR>
The gods are just, and will revenge our cause.<BR>
Aeneas was our prince: a juster lord,<BR>
Or nobler warrior, never drew a sword;<BR>
Observant of the right, religious of his word.<BR>
If yet he lives, and draws this vital air,<BR>
Nor we, his friends, of safety shall despair;<BR>
Nor you, great queen, these offices repent,<BR>
Which he will equal, and perhaps augment.<BR>
We want not cities, nor Sicilian coasts,<BR>
Where King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts.<BR>
Permit our ships a shelter on your shores,<BR>
Refitted from your woods with planks and oars,<BR>
That, if our prince be safe, we may renew<BR>
Our destin'd course, and Italy pursue.<BR>
But if, O best of men, the Fates ordain<BR>
That thou art swallow'd in the Libyan main,<BR>
And if our young Iulus be no more,<BR>

You seek the good Acestes' government,<BR>

And sail, with ships of convoy for your guard:<BR>
Or, would you stay, and join your friendly pow'rs<BR>
To raise and to defend the Tyrian tow'rs,<BR>
My wealth, my city, and myself are yours.<BR>
And would to Heav'n, the Storm, you felt, would bring<BR>
On Carthaginian coasts your wand'ring king.<BR>
My people shall, by my command, explore<BR>
The ports and creeks of ev'ry winding shore,<BR>
And towns, and wilds, and shady woods, in quest<BR>
Of so renown'd and so desir'd a guest."<BR>

Rais'd in his mind the Trojan hero stood,<BR>
And long'd to break from out his ambient cloud:<BR>
Achates found it, and thus urg'd his way:<BR>
"From whence, O goddess-born, this long delay?<BR>
What more can you desire, your welcome sure,<BR>
Your fleet in safety, and your friends secure?<BR>
One only wants; and him we saw in vain<BR>
Oppose the Storm, and swallow'd in the main.<BR>
Orontes in his fate our forfeit paid;<BR>
The rest agrees with what your mother said."<BR>
Scarce had he spoken, when the cloud gave way,<BR>
The mists flew upward and dissolv'd in day.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The Trojan chief appear'd in open sight,<BR>
August in visage, and serenely bright.<BR>
His mother goddess, with her hands divine,<BR>
Had form'd his curling locks, and made his temples shine,<BR>
And giv'n his rolling eyes a sparkling grace,<BR>
And breath'd a youthful vigor on his face;<BR>
Like polish'd ivory, beauteous to behold,<BR>
Or Parian marble, when enchas'd in gold:<BR>
Thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke,<BR>
And thus with manly modesty he spoke:<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"He whom you seek am I; by tempests toss'd,<BR>
And sav'd from shipwreck on your Libyan coast;<BR>
Presenting, gracious queen, before your throne,<BR>
A prince that owes his life to you alone.<BR>
Fair majesty, the refuge and redress<BR>
Of those whom fate pursues, and wants oppress,<BR>
You, who your pious offices employ<BR>
To save the relics of abandon'd Troy;<BR>
Receive the shipwreck'd on your friendly shore,<BR>
With hospitable rites relieve the poor;<BR>
Associate in your town a wand'ring train,<BR>
And strangers in your palace entertain:<BR>
What thanks can wretched fugitives return,<BR>
Who, scatter'd thro' the world, in exile mourn?<BR>
The gods, if gods to goodness are inclin'd;<BR>
If acts of mercy touch their heav'nly mind,<BR>
And, more than all the gods, your gen'rous heart.<BR>
Conscious of worth, requite its own desert!<BR>
In you this age is happy, and this earth,<BR>
And parents more than mortal gave you birth.<BR>
While rolling rivers into seas shall run,<BR>
And round the space of heav'n the radiant sun;<BR>
While trees the mountain tops with shades supply,<BR>
Your honor, name, and praise shall never die.<BR>
Whate'er abode my fortune has assign'd,<BR>
Your image shall be present in my mind."<BR>
Thus having said, he turn'd with pious haste,<BR>
And joyful his expecting friends embrac'd:<BR>
With his right hand Ilioneus was grac'd,<BR>
Serestus with his left; then to his breast<BR>
Cloanthus and the noble Gyas press'd;<BR>

"What fate, O goddess-born; what angry pow'rs<BR>

Are you the great Aeneas, known to fame,<BR>
Who from celestial seed your lineage claim?<BR>

The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore<BR>

And sought my father's aid, to be restor'd:<BR>
My father Belus then with fire and sword<BR>
Invaded Cyprus, made the region bare,<BR>

From him the Trojan siege I understood,<BR>

Your foe himself the Dardan valor prais'd,<BR>
And his own ancestry from Trojans rais'd.<BR>
Enter, my noble guest, and you shall find,<BR>
If not a costly welcome, yet a kind:<BR>
For I myself, like you, have been distress'd,<BR>
Till Heav'n afforded me this place of rest;<BR>
Like you, an alien in a land unknown,<BR>
I learn to pity woes so like my own."<BR>
She said, and to the palace led her guest;<BR>
Then offer'd incense, and proclaim'd a feast.<BR>
Nor yet less careful for her absent friends,<BR>
Twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends;<BR>
Besides a hundred boars, a hundred lambs,<BR>
With bleating cries, attend their milky dams;<BR>
And jars of gen'rous wine and spacious bowls<BR>
She gives, to cheer the sailors' drooping souls.<BR>
Now purple hangings clothe the palace walls,<BR>
And sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls:<BR>
On Tyrian carpets, richly wrought, they dine;<BR>
With loads of massy plate the sideboards shine,<BR>
And antique vases, all of gold emboss'd<BR>
(The gold itself inferior to the cost),<BR>
Of curious work, where on the sides were seen<BR>
The fights and figures of illustrious men,<BR>
From their first founder to the present queen.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The good Aeneas, paternal care<BR>
Iulus' absence could no longer bear,<BR>
Dispatch'd Achates to the ships in haste,<BR>
To give a glad relation of the past,<BR>
And, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy,<BR>
Snatch'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy:<BR>
A robe of tissue, stiff with golden wire;<BR>
An upper vest, once Helen's rich attire,<BR>
From Argos by the fam'd adultress brought,<BR>
With golden flow'rs and winding foliage wrought,<BR>
Her mother Leda's present, when she came<BR>
To ruin Troy and set the world on flame;<BR>
The scepter Priam's eldest daughter bore,<BR>
Her orient necklace, and the crown she wore<BR>
Of double texture, glorious to behold,<BR>
One order set with gems, and one with gold.<BR>
Instructed thus, the wise Achates goes,<BR>
And in his diligence his duty shows.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
But Venus, anxious for her son's affairs,<BR>
New counsels tries, and new designs prepares:<BR>
That Cupid should assume the shape and face<BR>
Of sweet Ascanius, and the sprightly grace;<BR>
Should bring the presents, in her nephew's stead,<BR>
And in Eliza's veins the gentle poison shed:<BR>
For much she fear'd the Tyrians, double-tongued,<BR>
And knew the town to Juno's care belong'd.<BR>
These thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke,<BR>
And thus alarm'd, to winged Love she spoke:<BR>
"My son, my strength, whose mighty pow'r alone<BR>
Controls the Thund'rer on his awful throne,<BR>
To thee thy much-afflicted mother flies,<BR>
And on thy succor and thy faith relies.<BR>
Thou know'st, my son, how Jove's revengeful wife,<BR>
By force and fraud, attempts thy brother's life;<BR>
And often hast thou mourn'd with me his pains.<BR>
Him Dido now with blandishment detains;<BR>
But I suspect the town where Juno reigns.<BR>
For this 't is needful to prevent her art,<BR>
And fire with love the proud Phoenician's heart:<BR>
A love so violent, so strong, so sure,<BR>
As neither age can change, nor art can cure.<BR>
How this may be perform'd, now take my mind:<BR>
Ascanius by his father is design'd<BR>
To come, with presents laden, from the port,<BR>
To gratify the queen, and gain the court.<BR>
I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep,<BR>
And, ravish'd, in Idalian bow'rs to keep,<BR>
Or high Cythera, that the sweet deceit<BR>
May pass unseen, and none prevent the cheat.<BR>
Take thou his form and shape. I beg the grace<BR>
But only for a night's revolving space:<BR>
Thyself a boy, assume a boy's dissembled face;<BR>
That when, amidst the fervor of the feast,<BR>
The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast,<BR>
And with sweet kisses in her arms constrains,<BR>
Thou may'st infuse thy venom in her veins."<BR>
The God of Love obeys, and sets aside<BR>
His bow and quiver, and his plumy pride;<BR>
He walks Iulus in his mother's sight,<BR>
And in the sweet resemblance takes delight.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The goddess then to young Ascanius flies,<BR>
And in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes:<BR>
Lull'd in her lap, amidst a train of Loves,<BR>
She gently bears him to her blissful groves,<BR>
Then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head,<BR>
And softly lays him on a flow'ry bed.<BR>
Cupid meantime assum'd his form and face,<BR>
Foll'wing Achates with a shorter pace,<BR>
And brought the gifts. The queen already sate<BR>
Amidst the Trojan lords, in shining state,<BR>
High on a golden bed: her princely guest<BR>
Was next her side; in order sate the rest.<BR>
Then canisters with bread are heap'd on high;<BR>
Th' attendants water for their hands supply,<BR>
And, having wash'd, with silken towels dry.<BR>
Next fifty handmaids in long order bore<BR>
The censers, and with fumes the gods adore:<BR>
Then youths, and virgins twice as many, join<BR>
To place the dishes, and to serve the wine.<BR>
The Tyrian train, admitted to the feast,<BR>
Approach, and on the painted couches rest.<BR>
All on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze,<BR>
But view the beauteous boy with more amaze,<BR>
His rosy-color'd cheeks, his radiant eyes,<BR>
His motions, voice, and shape, and all the god's disguise;<BR>
Nor pass unprais'd the vest and veil divine,<BR>
Which wand'ring foliage and rich flow'rs entwine.<BR>
But, far above the rest, the royal dame,<BR>
(Already doom'd to love's disastrous flame,)<BR>
With eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy,<BR>
Beholds the presents, and admires the boy.<BR>
The guileful god about the hero long,<BR>
With children's play, and false embraces, hung;<BR>
Then sought the queen: she took him to her arms<BR>
With greedy pleasure, and devour'd his charms.<BR>
Unhappy Dido little thought what guest,<BR>
How dire a god, she drew so near her breast;<BR>
But he, not mindless of his mother's pray'r,<BR>
Works in the pliant bosom of the fair,<BR>
And molds her heart anew, and blots her former care.<BR>
The dead is to the living love resign'd;<BR>
And all Aeneas enters in her mind.<BR>

Now, when the rage of hunger was appeas'd,<BR>
The meat remov'd, and ev'ry guest was pleas'd,<BR>
The golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown'd,<BR>
And thro' the palace cheerful cries resound.<BR>
From gilded roofs depending lamps display<BR>
Nocturnal beams, that emulate the day.<BR>
A golden bowl, that shone with gems divine,<BR>
The queen commanded to be crown'd with wine:<BR>
The bowl that Belus us'd, and all the Tyrian line.<BR>
Then, silence thro' the hall proclaim'd, she spoke:<BR>
"O hospitable Jove! we thus invoke,<BR>
With solemn rites, thy sacred name and pow'r;<BR>
Bless to both nations this auspicious hour!<BR>
So may the Trojan and the Tyrian line<BR>
In lasting concord from this day combine.<BR>
Thou, Bacchus, god of joys and friendly cheer,<BR>
And gracious Juno, both be present here!<BR>
And you, my lords of Tyre, your vows address<BR>
To Heav'n with mine, to ratify the peace."<BR>
The goblet then she took, with nectar crown'd<BR>
(Sprinkling the first libations on the ground,)<BR>
And rais'd it to her mouth with sober grace;<BR>
Then, sipping, offer'd to the next in place.<BR>
'T was Bitias whom she call'd, a thirsty soul;<BR>
He took challenge, and embrac'd the bowl,<BR>
With pleasure swill'd the gold, nor ceas'd to draw,<BR>
Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw.<BR>
The goblet goes around: Iopas brought<BR>
His golden lyre, and sung what ancient Atlas taught:<BR>
The various labors of the wand'ring moon,<BR>
And whence proceed th' eclipses of the sun;<BR>
Th' original of men and beasts; and whence<BR>
The rains arise, and fires their warmth dispense,<BR>
And fix'd and erring stars dispose their influence;<BR>
What shakes the solid earth; what cause delays<BR>
The summer nights and shortens winter days.<BR>
With peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song:<BR>
Those peals are echo'd by the Trojan throng.<BR>
Th' unhappy queen with talk prolong'd the night,<BR>
And drank large draughts of love with vast delight;<BR>
Of Priam much enquir'd, of Hector more;<BR>
Then ask'd what arms the swarthy Memnon wore,<BR>
What troops he landed on the Trojan shore;<BR>
The steeds of Diomede varied the discourse,<BR>
And fierce Achilles, with his matchless force;<BR>
At length, as fate and her ill stars requir'd,<BR>
To hear the series of the war desir'd.<BR>
"Relate at large, my godlike guest," she said,<BR>
"The Grecian stratagems, the town betray'd:<BR>
The fatal issue of so long a war,<BR>
Your flight, your wand'rings, and your woes, declare;<BR>
For, since on ev'ry sea, on ev'ry coast,<BR>

An empire from its old foundations rent,<BR>
And ev'ry woe the Trojans underwent;<BR>
A peopled city made a desart place;<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
"By destiny compell'd, and in despair,<BR>
The Greeks grew weary of the tedious war,<BR>
And by Minerva's aid a fabric rear'd,<BR>
Which like a steed of monstrous height appear'd:<BR>
The sides were plank'd with pine; they feign'd it made<BR>
For their return, and this the vow they paid.<BR>
Thus they pretend, but in the hollow side<BR>
Selected numbers of their soldiers hide:<BR>
With inward arms the dire machine they load,<BR>
And iron bowels stuff the dark abode.<BR>
In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an isle<BR>
(While Fortune did on Priam's empire smile)<BR>
Renown'd for wealth; but, since, a faithless bay,<BR>
Where ships expos'd to wind and weather lay.<BR>
There was their fleet conceal'd. We thought, for Greece<BR>
Their sails were hoisted, and our fears release.<BR>
The Trojans, coop'd within their walls so long,<BR>
Unbar their gates, and issue in a throng,<BR>
Like swarming bees, and with delight survey<BR>
The camp deserted, where the Grecians lay:<BR>
The quarters of the sev'ral chiefs they show'd;<BR>
Here Phoenix, here Achilles, made abode;<BR>
Here join'd the battles; there the navy rode.<BR>
Part on the pile their wond'ring eyes employ:<BR>
The pile by Pallas rais'd to ruin Troy.<BR>
Thymoetes first ('t is doubtful whether hir'd,<BR>
Or so the Trojan destiny requir'd)<BR>
Mov'd that the ramparts might be broken down,<BR>
To lodge the monster fabric in the town.<BR>
But Capys, and the rest of sounder mind,<BR>
The fatal present to the flames designed,<BR>
Or to the wat'ry deep; at least to bore<BR>
The hollow sides, and hidden frauds explore.<BR>
The giddy vulgar, as their fancies guide,<BR>
With noise say nothing, and in parts divide.<BR>
Laocoon, follow'd by a num'rous crowd,<BR>
Ran from the fort, and cried, from far, aloud:<BR>
'O wretched countrymen! what fury reigns?<BR>
What more than madness has possess'd your brains?<BR>
Think you the Grecians from your coasts are gone?<BR>
And are Ulysses' arts no better known?<BR>
This hollow fabric either must inclose,<BR>
Within its blind recess, our secret foes;<BR>
Or 't is an engine rais'd above the town,<BR>
T' o'erlook the walls, and then to batter down.<BR>
Somewhat is sure design'd, by fraud or force:<BR>
Trust not their presents, nor admit the horse.'<BR>
Thus having said, against the steed he threw<BR>
His forceful spear, which, hissing as flew,<BR>
Pierc'd thro' the yielding planks of jointed wood,<BR>
And trembling in the hollow belly stood.<BR>
The sides, transpierc'd, return a rattling sound,<BR>
And groans of Greeks inclos'd come issuing thro' the wound<BR>
And, had not Heav'n the fall of Troy design'd,<BR>
Or had not men been fated to be blind,<BR>
Enough was said and done t'inspire a better mind.<BR>
Then had our lances pierc'd the treach'rous wood,<BR>
And Ilian tow'rs and Priam's empire stood.<BR>
Meantime, with shouts, the Trojan shepherds bring<BR>
A captive Greek, in bands, before the king;<BR>
Taken to take; who made himself their prey,<BR>
T' impose on their belief, and Troy betray;<BR>
Fix'd on his aim, and obstinately bent<BR>
To die undaunted, or to circumvent.<BR>
About the captive, tides of Trojans flow;<BR>
All press to see, and some insult the foe.<BR>
Now hear how well the Greeks their wiles disguis'd;<BR>
Behold a nation in a man compris'd.<BR>
Trembling the miscreant stood, unarm'd and bound;<BR>
He star'd, and roll'd his haggard eyes around,<BR>
Then said: 'Alas! what earth remains, what sea<BR>
Is open to receive unhappy me?<BR>
What fate a wretched fugitive attends,<BR>
Scorn'd by my foes, abandon'd by my friends?'<BR>
He said, and sigh'd, and cast a rueful eye:<BR>
Our pity kindles, and our passions die.<BR>
We cheer youth to make his own defense,<BR>
And freely tell us what he was, and whence:<BR>
What news he could impart, we long to know,<BR>
And what to credit from a captive foe.<BR>

While Fortune favor'd, while his arms support<BR>

I made some figure there; nor was my name<BR>
Obscure, nor I without my share of fame.<BR>

Ambiguous rumors thro' the camp he spread,<BR>

New crimes invented; left unturn'd no stone,<BR>

Till Calchas was by force and threat'ning wrought-<BR>
But why- why dwell I on that anxious thought?<BR>
If on my nation just revenge you seek,<BR>

Already you my name and country know;<BR>
Assuage your thirst of blood, and strike the blow:<BR>

"A greater omen, and of worse portent,<BR>
Did our unwary minds with fear torment,<BR>
Concurring to produce the dire event.<BR>
Laocoon, Neptune's priest by lot that year,<BR>
With solemn pomp then sacrific'd a steer;<BR>
When, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied<BR>
Two serpents, rank'd abreast, the seas divide,<BR>
And smoothly sweep along the swelling tide.<BR>
Their flaming crests above the waves they show;<BR>
Their bellies seem to burn the seas below;<BR>
Their speckled tails advance to steer their course,<BR>
And on the sounding shore the flying billows force.<BR>
And now the strand, and now the plain they held;<BR>
Their ardent eyes with bloody streaks were fill'd;<BR>
Their nimble tongues they brandish'd as they came,<BR>
And lick'd their hissing jaws, that sputter'd flame.<BR>
We fled amaz'd; their destin'd way they take,<BR>
And to Laocoon and his children make;<BR>
And first around the tender boys they wind,<BR>
Then with their sharpen'd fangs their limbs and bodies grind.<BR>
The wretched father, running to their aid<BR>
With pious haste, but vain, they next invade;<BR>
Twice round his waist their winding volumes roll'd;<BR>
And twice about his gasping throat they fold.<BR>
The priest thus doubly chok'd, their crests divide,<BR>
And tow'ring o'er his head in triumph ride.<BR>
With both his hands he labors at the knots;<BR>
His holy fillets the blue venom blots;<BR>
His roaring fills the flitting air around.<BR>
Thus, when an ox receives a glancing wound,<BR>
He breaks his bands, the fatal altar flies,<BR>
And with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies.<BR>
Their tasks perform'd, the serpents quit their prey,<BR>
And to the tow'r of Pallas make their way:<BR>
Couch'd at her feet, they lie protected there<BR>
By her large buckler and protended spear.<BR>
Amazement seizes all; the gen'ral cry<BR>
Proclaims Laocoon justly doom'd to die,<BR>
Whose hand the will of Pallas had withstood,<BR>
And dared to violate the sacred wood.<BR>
All vote t' admit the steed, that vows be paid<BR>
And incense offer'd to th' offended maid.<BR>
A spacious breach is made; the town lies bare;<BR>
Some hoisting-levers, some the wheels prepare<BR>
And fasten to the horse's feet; the rest<BR>
With cables haul along th' unwieldly beast.<BR>
Each on his fellow for assistance calls;<BR>
At length the fatal fabric mounts the walls,<BR>
Big with destruction. Boys with chaplets crown'd,<BR>
And choirs of virgins, sing and dance around.<BR>
Thus rais'd aloft, and then descending down,<BR>
It enters o'er our heads, and threats the town.<BR>
O sacred city, built by hands divine!<BR>
O valiant heroes of the Trojan line!<BR>
Four times he struck: as oft the clashing sound<BR>
Of arms was heard, and inward groans rebound.<BR>
Yet, mad with zeal, and blinded with our fate,<BR>
We haul along the horse in solemn state;<BR>
Then place the dire portent within the tow'r.<BR>
Cassandra cried, and curs'd th' unhappy hour;<BR>
Foretold our fate; but, by the god's decree,<BR>
All heard, and none believ'd the prophecy.<BR>
With branches we the fanes adorn, and waste,<BR>
In jollity, the day ordain'd to be the last.<BR>
Meantime the rapid heav'ns roll'd down the light,<BR>
And on the shaded ocean rush'd the night;<BR>
Our men, secure, nor guards nor sentries held,<BR>
But easy sleep their weary limbs compell'd.<BR>
The Grecians had embark'd their naval pow'rs<BR>
From Tenedos, and sought our well-known shores,<BR>
Safe under covert of the silent night,<BR>
And guided by th' imperial galley's light;<BR>
When Sinon, favor'd by the partial gods,<BR>
Unlock'd the horse, and op'd his dark abodes;<BR>
Restor'd to vital air our hidden foes,<BR>
Who joyful from their long confinement rose.<BR>
Tysander bold, and Sthenelus their guide,<BR>
And dire Ulysses down the cable slide:<BR>
Then Thoas, Athamas, and Pyrrhus haste;<BR>
Nor was the Podalirian hero last,<BR>
Nor injur'd Menelaus, nor the fam'd<BR>
Epeus, who the fatal engine fram'd.<BR>
A nameless crowd succeed; their forces join<BR>
T' invade the town, oppress'd with sleep and wine.<BR>
Those few they find awake first meet their fate;<BR>
Then to their fellows they unbar the gate.<BR>

Such as he was, when, by Pelides slain,<BR>
Thessalian coursers dragg'd him o'er the plain.<BR>

The flames and horrors of this fatal night.<BR>
The foes already have possess'd the wall;<BR>
Troy nods from high, and totters to her fall.<BR>
Enough is paid to Priam's royal name,<BR>
More than enough to duty and to fame.<BR>
If by a mortal hand my father's throne<BR>
Could be defended, 't was by mine alone.<BR>
Now Troy to thee commends her future state,<BR>

Louder, and yet more loud, I hear th' alarms<BR>

Fear broke my slumbers; I no longer stay,<BR>

Th' unequal combat in the public square:<BR>
Night was our friend; our leader was despair.<BR>

An ancient and imperial city falls:<BR>

You loiter, while the spoils are borne away:<BR>
Our ships are laden with the Trojan store;<BR>

He starts aside, astonish'd, when he spies<BR>
His rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes;<BR>
So from our arms surpris'd Androgeos flies.<BR>
In vain; for him and his we compass'd round,<BR>
Possess'd with fear, unknowing of the ground,<BR>
And of their lives an easy conquest found.<BR>
Thus Fortune on our first endeavor smil'd.<BR>
Coroebus then, with youthful hopes beguil'd,<BR>
Swoln with success, and a daring mind,<BR>
This new invention fatally design'd.<BR>
'My friends,' said he, 'since Fortune shows the way,<BR>

For what has she these Grecian arms bestow'd,<BR>
But their destruction, and the Trojans' good?<BR>
Then change we shields, and their devices bear:<BR>
Let fraud supply the want of force in war.<BR>
They find us arms.' This said, himself he dress'd<BR>
In dead Androgeos' spoils, his upper vest,<BR>
His painted buckler, and his plumy crest.<BR>
Thus Ripheus, Dymas, all the Trojan train,<BR>
Lay down their own attire, and strip the slain.<BR>
Mix'd with the Greeks, we go with ill presage,<BR>
Flatter'd with hopes to glut our greedy rage;<BR>
Unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet,<BR>
And strew with Grecian carcasses the street.<BR>

That common bane of Greece and Troy I found.<BR>
For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword;<BR>
More dreads the vengeance of her injur'd lord;<BR>
Ev'n by those gods who refug'd her abhorr'd.<BR>
Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard,<BR>
Resolv'd to give her guilt the due reward:<BR>
'Shall she triumphant sail before the wind,<BR>
And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind?<BR>
Shall she her kingdom and her friends review,<BR>
In state attended with a captive crew,<BR>
While unreveng'd the good old Priam falls,<BR>
And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls?<BR>
For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood<BR>
Were swell'd with bodies, and were drunk with blood?<BR>
'T is true, a soldier can small honor gain,<BR>
And boast no conquest, from a woman slain:<BR>
Yet shall the fact not pass without applause,<BR>
Of vengeance taken in so just a cause;<BR>
The punish'd crime shall set my soul at ease,<BR>
And murm'ring manes of my friends appease.'<BR>
Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light<BR>
Spread o'er the place; and, shining heav'nly bright,<BR>
My mother stood reveal'd before my sight<BR>
Never so radiant did her eyes appear;<BR>
Not her own star confess'd a light so clear:<BR>
Great in her charms, as when on gods above<BR>
She looks, and breathes herself into their love.<BR>
She held my hand, the destin'd blow to break;<BR>
Then from her rosy lips began to speak:<BR>
'My son, from whence this madness, this neglect<BR>
Of my commands, and those whom I protect?<BR>
Why this unmanly rage? Recall to mind<BR>
Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind.<BR>
Look if your helpless father yet survive,<BR>
Or if Ascanius or Creusa live.<BR>
Around your house the greedy Grecians err;<BR>
And these had perish'd in the nightly war,<BR>
But for my presence and protecting care.<BR>
Not Helen's face, nor Paris, was in fault;<BR>
But by the gods was this destruction brought.<BR>
Now cast your eyes around, while I dissolve<BR>
The mists and films that mortal eyes involve,<BR>
Purge from your sight the dross, and make you see<BR>
The shape of each avenging deity.<BR>
Enlighten'd thus, my just commands fulfil,<BR>
Nor fear obedience to your mother's will.<BR>
Where yon disorder'd heap of ruin lies,<BR>
Stones rent from stones; where clouds of dust arise-<BR>
Amid that smother Neptune holds his place,<BR>
Below the wall's foundation drives his mace,<BR>
And heaves the building from the solid base.<BR>
Look where, in arms, imperial Juno stands<BR>
Full in the Scaean gate, with loud commands,<BR>
Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands.<BR>
See! Pallas, of her snaky buckler proud,<BR>
Bestrides the tow'r, refulgent thro' the cloud:<BR>
See! Jove new courage to the foe supplies,<BR>
And arms against the town the partial deities.<BR>
Haste hence, my son; this fruitless labor end:<BR>
Haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend:<BR>
Haste; and a mother's care your passage shall befriend.'<BR>
She said, and swiftly vanish'd from my sight,<BR>
Obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night.<BR>
I look'd, I listen'd; dreadful sounds I hear;<BR>
And the dire forms of hostile gods appear.<BR>
Troy sunk in flames I saw (nor could prevent),<BR>
And Ilium from its old foundations rent;<BR>
Rent like a mountain ash, which dar'd the winds,<BR>
And stood the sturdy strokes of lab'ring hinds.<BR>
About the roots the cruel ax resounds;<BR>
The stumps are pierc'd with oft-repeated wounds:<BR>
The war is felt on high; the nodding crown<BR>
Now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honors down.<BR>
To their united force it yields, tho' late,<BR>
And mourns with mortal groans th' approaching fate:<BR>
The roots no more their upper load sustain;<BR>
But down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro' the plain.<BR>

A lambent flame arose, which gently spread<BR>
Around his brows, and on his temples fed.<BR>
Amaz'd, with running water we prepare<BR>
To quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair;<BR>
But old Anchises, vers'd in omens, rear'd<BR>
His hands to heav'n, and this request preferr'd:<BR>
'If any vows, almighty Jove, can bend<BR>
Thy will; if piety can pray'rs commend,<BR>
Confirm the glad presage which thou art pleas'd to send.'<BR>

Whom did I not, of gods or men, accuse!<BR>

Stung with my loss, and raving with despair,<BR>
Abandoning my now forgotten care,<BR>
Of counsel, comfort, and of hope bereft,<BR>
My sire, my son, my country gods I left.<BR>
In shining armor once again I sheathe<BR>
My limbs, not feeling wounds, nor fearing death.<BR>

I tread my former tracks; thro' night explore<BR>
Each passage, ev'ry street I cross'd before.<BR>
All things were full of horror and affright,<BR>
And dreadful ev'n the silence of the night.<BR>
Then to my father's house I make repair,<BR>
With some small glimpse of hope to find her there.<BR>
Instead of her, the cruel Greeks I met;<BR>
The house was fill'd with foes, with flames beset.<BR>
Driv'n on the wings of winds, whole sheets of fire,<BR>
Thro' air transported, to the roofs aspire.<BR>
From thence to Priam's palace I resort,<BR>
And search the citadel and desart court.<BR>

A guard of Grecians had possess'd the porch;<BR>
There Phoenix and Ulysses watch prey,<BR>
And thither all the wealth of Troy convey:<BR>
The spoils which they from ransack'd houses brought,<BR>
And golden bowls from burning altars caught,<BR>
The tables of the gods, the purple vests,<BR>
The people's treasure, and the pomp of priests.<BR>
A rank of wretched youths, with pinion'd hands,<BR>
And captive matrons, in long order stands.<BR>
Then, with ungovern'd madness, I proclaim,<BR>
Thro' all the silent street, Creusa's name:<BR>
Creusa still I call; at length she hears,<BR>
And sudden thro' the shades of night appears-<BR>
Appears, no more Creusa, nor my wife,<BR>
But a pale specter, larger than the life.<BR>
Aghast, astonish'd, and struck dumb with fear,<BR>
I stood; like bristles rose my stiffen'd hair.<BR>
Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief<BR>
'Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief.<BR>
Desist, my much-lov'd lord,'t indulge your pain;<BR>
You bear no more than what the gods ordain.<BR>
My fates permit me not from hence to fly;<BR>
Nor he, the great controller of the sky.<BR>
Long wand'ring ways for you the pow'rs decree;<BR>
On land hard labors, and a length of sea.<BR>
Then, after many painful years are past,<BR>
On Latium's happy shore you shall be cast,<BR>
Where gentle Tiber from his bed beholds<BR>
The flow'ry meadows, and the feeding folds.<BR>
There end your toils; and there your fates provide<BR>
A quiet kingdom, and a royal bride:<BR>
There fortune shall the Trojan line restore,<BR>
And you for lost Creusa weep no more.<BR>
Fear not that I shall watch, with servile shame,<BR>
Th' imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame;<BR>
Or, stooping to the victor's lust, disgrace<BR>
My goddess mother, or my royal race.<BR>
And now, farewell! The parent of the gods<BR>
Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes:<BR>
I trust our common issue to your care.'<BR>
She said, and gliding pass'd unseen in air.<BR>
I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue;<BR>
And thrice about her neck my arms I flung,<BR>

Sharp myrtles on the sides, and cornels grew.<BR>
There, while I went to crop the sylvan scenes,<BR>

My fright, and then these dreadful words ensued:<BR>
'Why dost thou thus my buried body rend?<BR>
O spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend!<BR>
Spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood:<BR>
The tears distil not from the wounded wood;<BR>

He tells thee here, and sends us to relate.<BR>
Those pow'rs are we, companions of thy fate,<BR>
Who from the burning town by thee were brought,<BR>
Thy fortune follow'd, and thy safety wrought.<BR>
Thro' seas and lands as we thy steps attend,<BR>
So shall our care thy glorious race befriend.<BR>
An ample realm for thee thy fates ordain,<BR>
A town that o'er the conquer'd world shall reign.<BR>
Thou, mighty walls for mighty nations build;<BR>
Nor let thy weary mind to labors yield:<BR>
But change thy seat; for not the Delian god,<BR>

A land there is, Hesperia call'd of old,<BR>
(The soil is fruitful, and the natives bold-<BR>
Th' Oenotrians held it once,) by later fame<BR>
Now call'd Italia, from the leader's name.<BR>
lasius there and Dardanus were born;<BR>
From thence we came, and thither must return.<BR>
Rise, and thy sire with these glad tidings greet.<BR>

In perfect view, their hair with fillets tied;)<BR>
I started from my couch; a clammy sweat<BR>
On all my limbs and shiv'ring body sate.<BR>
To heav'n I lift my hands with pious haste,<BR>
And sacred incense in the flames I cast.<BR>
Thus to the gods their perfect honors done,<BR>
More cheerful, to my good old sire I run,<BR>
And tell the pleasing news. In little space<BR>
He found his error of the double race;<BR>

They snatch the meat, defiling all they find,<BR>

Close by a hollow rock, again we sit,<BR>
New dress the dinner, and the beds refit,<BR>

Then all the fleet by his example steer'd.<BR>
To heav'n aloft on ridgy waves we ride,<BR>
Then down to hell descend, when they divide;<BR>
And thrice our galleys knock'd the stony ground,<BR>
And thrice the hollow rocks return'd the sound,<BR>
And thrice we saw the stars, that stood with dews around.<BR>
The flagging winds forsook us, with the sun;<BR>
And, wearied, on Cyclopian shores we run.<BR>
The port capacious, and secure from wind,<BR>
Is to the foot of thund'ring Aetna join'd.<BR>
By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high;<BR>
By turns hot embers from her entrails fly,<BR>
And flakes of mounting flames, that lick the sky.<BR>
Oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown,<BR>
And, shiver'd by the force, come piecemeal down.<BR>
Oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow,<BR>
Fed from the fiery springs that boil below.<BR>
Enceladus, they say, transfix'd by Jove,<BR>
With blasted limbs came tumbling from above;<BR>
And, where he fell, th' avenging father drew<BR>
This flaming hill, and on his body threw.<BR>
As often as he turns his weary sides,<BR>
He shakes the solid isle, and smoke the heavens hides.<BR>
In shady woods we pass the tedious night,<BR>
Where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright,<BR>
Of which no cause is offer'd to the sight;<BR>
For not one star was kindled in the sky,<BR>
Nor could the moon her borrow'd light supply;<BR>
For misty clouds involv'd the firmament,<BR>
The stars were muffled, and the moon was pent.<BR>

"Scarce had the rising sun the day reveal'd,<BR>
Scarce had his heat the pearly dews dispell'd,<BR>
When from the woods there bolts, before our sight,<BR>
Somewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite,<BR>
So thin, so ghastly meager, and so wan,<BR>
So bare of flesh, he scarce resembled man.<BR>

His clothes were tagg'd with thorns, and filth his limbs<BR>

Stood still, and paus'd; then all at once began<BR>
To stretch his limbs, and trembled as he ran.<BR>
Soon as approach'd, upon his knees he falls,<BR>
And thus with tears and sighs for pity calls:<BR>
'Now, by the pow'rs above, and what we share<BR>
From Nature's common gift, this vital air,<BR>
O Trojans, take me hence! I beg no more;<BR>
But bear me far from this unhappy shore.<BR>
'T is true, I am a Greek, and farther own,<BR>
Among your foes besieg'd th' imperial town.<BR>
For such demerits if my death be due,<BR>
No more for this abandon'd life I sue;<BR>
This only favor let my tears obtain,<BR>
To throw me headlong in the rapid main:<BR>
Since nothing more than death my crime demands,<BR>
I die content, to die by human hands.'<BR>
He said, and on his knees my knees embrac'd:<BR>
I bade him boldly tell his fortune past,<BR>
His present state, his lineage, and his name,<BR>
Th' occasion of his fears, and whence he came.<BR>
The good Anchises rais'd him with his hand;<BR>
Who, thus encourag'd, answer'd our demand:<BR>
'From Ithaca, my native soil, I came<BR>
To Troy; and Achaemenides my name.<BR>
Me my poor father with Ulysses sent;<BR>
(O had I stay'd, with poverty content!)<BR>
But, fearful for themselves, my countrymen<BR>
Left me forsaken in the Cyclops' den.<BR>
The cave, tho' large, was dark; the dismal floor<BR>
Was pav'd with mangled limbs and putrid gore.<BR>
Our monstrous host, of more than human size,<BR>
Erects his head, and stares within the skies;<BR>
Bellowing his voice, and horrid is his hue.<BR>
Ye gods, remove this plague from mortal view!<BR>
The joints of slaughter'd wretches are his food;<BR>
And for his wine he quaffs the streaming blood.<BR>
These eyes beheld, when with his spacious hand<BR>
He seiz'd two captives of our Grecian band;<BR>
Stretch'd on his back, he dash'd against the stones<BR>
Their broken bodies, and their crackling bones:<BR>
With spouting blood the purple pavement swims,<BR>

His indigested foam, and morsels raw;<BR>
We pray; we cast the lots, and then surround<BR>
The monstrous body, stretch'd along the ground:<BR>
Each, as he could approach him, lends a hand<BR>
To bore his eyeball with a flaming brand.<BR>
Beneath his frowning forehead lay his eye;<BR>
For only one did the vast frame supply-<BR>
But that a globe so large, his front it fill'd,<BR>
Like the sun's disk or like a Grecian shield.<BR>
The stroke succeeds; and down the pupil bends:<BR>
This vengeance follow'd for our slaughter'd friends.<BR>
But haste, unhappy wretches, haste to fly!<BR>
Your cables cut, and on your oars rely!<BR>
Such, and so vast as Polypheme appears,<BR>

I drag my loathsome days with mortal fright,<BR>
And in deserted caverns lodge by night;<BR>
Oft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see<BR>
Of the huge Cyclops, like a walking tree:<BR>
From far I hear his thund'ring voice resound,<BR>
And trampling feet that shake the solid ground.<BR>
Cornels and salvage berries of the wood,<BR>
And roots and herbs, have been my meager food.<BR>
While all around my longing eyes I cast,<BR>
I saw your happy ships appear at last.<BR>
On those I fix'd my hopes, to these I run;<BR>

An equal fate on either side appears:<BR>
We, tacking to the left, are free from fears;<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
His vows, in haughty terms, he thus preferr'd,<BR>
And held his altar's horns. The mighty Thund'rer heard;<BR>
Then cast his eyes on Carthage, where he found<BR>
The lustful pair in lawless pleasure drown'd,<BR>
Lost in their loves, insensible of shame,<BR>
And both forgetful of their better fame.<BR>
He calls Cyllenius, and the god attends,<BR>
By whom his menacing command he sends:<BR>
"Go, mount the western winds, and cleave the sky;<BR>
Then, with a swift descent, to Carthage fly:<BR>
There find the Trojan chief, who wastes his days<BR>
In slothful riot and inglorious ease,<BR>
Nor minds the future city, giv'n by fate.<BR>
To him this message from my mouth relate:<BR>
'Not so fair Venus hop'd, when twice she won<BR>
Thy life with pray'rs, nor promis'd such a son.<BR>
Hers was a hero, destin'd to command<BR>
A martial race, and rule the Latian land,<BR>
Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw,<BR>
And on the conquer'd world impose the law.'<BR>
If glory cannot move a mind so mean,<BR>
Nor future praise from fading pleasure wean,<BR>
Yet why should he defraud his son of fame,<BR>
And grudge the Romans their immortal name!<BR>
What are his vain designs! what hopes he more<BR>
From his long ling'ring on a hostile shore,<BR>
Regardless to redeem his honor lost,<BR>
And for his race to gain th' Ausonian coast!<BR>
Bid him with speed the Tyrian court forsake;<BR>
With this command the slumb'ring warrior wake."<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds<BR>
His flying feet, and mounts the western winds:<BR>
And, whether o'er the seas or earth he flies,<BR>
With rapid force they bear him down the skies.<BR>
But first he grasps within his awful hand<BR>
The mark of sov'reign pow'r, his magic wand;<BR>
With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves;<BR>
With this he drives them down the Stygian waves;<BR>
With this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight,<BR>
And eyes, tho' clos'd in death, restores to light.<BR>
Thus arm'd, the god begins his airy race,<BR>
And drives the racking clouds along the liquid space;<BR>
Now sees the tops of Atlas, as he flies,<BR>
Whose brawny back supports the starry skies;<BR>
Atlas, whose head, with piny forests crown'd,<BR>
Is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapors bound.<BR>
Snows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin<BR>
The founts of rolling streams their race begin;<BR>
A beard of ice on his large breast depends.<BR>
Here, pois'd upon his wings, the god descends:<BR>
Then, rested thus, he from the tow'ring height<BR>
Plung'd downward, with precipitated flight,<BR>
Lights on the seas, and skims along the flood.<BR>
As waterfowl, who seek their fishy food,<BR>
Less, and yet less, to distant prospect show;<BR>
By turns they dance aloft, and dive below:<BR>
Like these, the steerage of his wings he plies,<BR>
And near the surface of the water flies,<BR>
Till, having pass'd the seas, and cross'd the sands,<BR>
He clos'd his wings, and stoop'd on Libyan lands:<BR>
Where shepherds once were hous'd in homely sheds,<BR>
Now tow'rs within the clouds advance their heads.<BR>
Arriving there, he found the Trojan prince<BR>
New ramparts raising for the town's defense.<BR>
A purple scarf, with gold embroider'd o'er,<BR>
(Queen Dido's gift,) about his waist he wore;<BR>
A sword, with glitt'ring gems diversified,<BR>
For ornament, not use, hung idly by his side.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then thus, with winged words, the god began,<BR>
Resuming his own shape: "Degenerate man,<BR>
Thou woman's property, what mak'st thou here,<BR>
These foreign walls and Tyrian tow'rs to rear,<BR>
Forgetful of thy own? All-pow'rful Jove,<BR>
Who sways the world below and heav'n above,<BR>
Has sent me down with this severe command:<BR>
What means thy ling'ring in the Libyan land?<BR>
If glory cannot move a mind so mean,<BR>
Nor future praise from flitting pleasure wean,<BR>
Regard the fortunes of thy rising heir:<BR>
The promis'd crown let young Ascanius wear,<BR>
To whom th' Ausonian scepter, and the state<BR>
Of Rome's imperial name is ow'd by fate."<BR>
So spoke the god; and, speaking, took his flight,<BR>
Involv'd in clouds, and vanish'd out of sight.<BR>

The pious prince was seiz'd with sudden fear;<BR>
Mute was his tongue, and upright stood his hair.<BR>
Revolving in his mind the stern command,<BR>
He longs to fly, and loathes the charming land.<BR>
What should he say? or how should he begin?<BR>
What course, alas! remains to steer between<BR>
Th' offended lover and the pow'rful queen?<BR>
This way and that he turns his anxious mind,<BR>
And all expedients tries, and none can find.<BR>
Fix'd on the deed, but doubtful of the means,<BR>
After long thought, to this advice he leans:<BR>
Three chiefs he calls, commands them to repair<BR>
The fleet, and ship their men with silent care;<BR>
Some plausible pretense he bids them find,<BR>
To color what in secret he design'd.<BR>
Himself, meantime, the softest hours would choose,<BR>
Before the love-sick lady heard the news;<BR>
And move her tender mind, by slow degrees,<BR>
To suffer what the sov'reign pow'r decrees:<BR>
Jove will inspire him, when, and what to say.<BR>
They hear with pleasure, and with haste obey.<BR>

But soon the queen perceives the thin disguise:<BR>
(What arts can blind a jealous woman's eyes!)<BR>
She was the first to find the secret fraud,<BR>
Before the fatal news was blaz'd abroad.<BR>
Love the first motions of the lover hears,<BR>
Quick to presage, and ev'n in safety fears.<BR>
Nor impious Fame was wanting to report<BR>
The ships repair'd, the Trojans' thick resort,<BR>
And purpose to forsake the Tyrian court.<BR>
Frantic with fear, impatient of the wound,<BR>
And impotent of mind, she roves the city round.<BR>
Less wild the Bacchanalian dames appear,<BR>
When, from afar, their nightly god they hear,<BR>
And howl about the hills, and shake the wreathy spear.<BR>
At length she finds the dear perfidious man;<BR>
Prevents his form'd excuse, and thus began:<BR>
"Base and ungrateful! could you hope to fly,<BR>
And undiscover'd scape a lover's eye?<BR>
Nor could my kindness your compassion move.<BR>
Nor plighted vows, nor dearer bands of love?<BR>
Or is the death of a despairing queen<BR>
Not worth preventing, tho' too well foreseen?<BR>
Ev'n when the wintry winds command your stay,<BR>
You dare the tempests, and defy the sea.<BR>
False as you are, suppose you were not bound<BR>
To lands unknown, and foreign coasts to sound;<BR>
Were Troy restor'd, and Priam's happy reign,<BR>
Now durst you tempt, for Troy, the raging main?<BR>
See whom you fly! am I the foe you shun?<BR>
Now, by those holy vows, so late begun,<BR>
By this right hand, (since I have nothing more<BR>
To challenge, but the faith you gave before;)<BR>
I beg you by these tears too truly shed,<BR>
By the new pleasures of our nuptial bed;<BR>
If ever Dido, when you most were kind,<BR>
Were pleasing in your eyes, or touch'd your mind;<BR>
By these my pray'rs, if pray'rs may yet have place,<BR>
Pity the fortunes of a falling race.<BR>
For you I have provok'd a tyrant's hate,<BR>
Incens'd the Libyan and the Tyrian state;<BR>
For you alone I suffer in my fame,<BR>
Bereft of honor, and expos'd to shame.<BR>
Whom have I now to trust, ungrateful guest?<BR>
(That only name remains of all the rest!)<BR>
What have I left? or whither can I fly?<BR>
Must I attend Pygmalion's cruelty,<BR>
Or till Hyarba shall in triumph lead<BR>
A queen that proudly scorn'd his proffer'd bed?<BR>
Had you deferr'd, at least, your hasty flight,<BR>
And left behind some pledge of our delight,<BR>
Some babe to bless the mother's mournful sight,<BR>
Some young Aeneas, to supply your place,<BR>
Whose features might express his father's face;<BR>
I should not then complain to live bereft<BR>
Of all my husband, or be wholly left."<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Here paus'd the queen. Unmov'd he holds his eyes,<BR>
By Jove's command; nor suffer'd love to rise,<BR>
Tho' heaving in his heart; and thus at length replies:<BR>
"Fair queen, you never can enough repeat<BR>
Your boundless favors, or I own my debt;<BR>
Nor can my mind forget Eliza's name,<BR>
While vital breath inspires this mortal frame.<BR>
This only let me speak in my defense:<BR>
I never hop'd a secret flight from hence,<BR>
Much less pretended to the lawful claim<BR>
Of sacred nuptials, or a husband's name.<BR>
For, if indulgent Heav'n would leave me free,<BR>
And not submit my life to fate's decree,<BR>
My choice would lead me to the Trojan shore,<BR>
Those relics to review, their dust adore,<BR>
And Priam's ruin'd palace to restore.<BR>
But now the Delphian oracle commands,<BR>
And fate invites me to the Latian lands.<BR>
That is the promis'd place to which I steer,<BR>
And all my vows are terminated there.<BR>
If you, a Tyrian, and a stranger born,<BR>
With walls and tow'rs a Libyan town adorn,<BR>
Why may not we- like you, a foreign race-<BR>
Like you, seek shelter in a foreign place?<BR>
As often as the night obscures the skies<BR>
With humid shades, or twinkling stars arise,<BR>
Anchises' angry ghost in dreams appears,<BR>
Chides my delay, and fills my soul with fears;<BR>
And young Ascanius justly may complain<BR>
Of his defrauded and destin'd reign.<BR>
Ev'n now the herald of the gods appear'd:<BR>
Waking I saw him, and his message heard.<BR>
From Jove he came commission'd, heav'nly bright<BR>
With radiant beams, and manifest to sight<BR>
(The sender and the sent I both attest)<BR>
These walls he enter'd, and those words express'd.<BR>
Fair queen, oppose not what the gods command;<BR>
Forc'd by my fate, I leave your happy land."<BR>

Thus while he spoke, already she began,<BR>
With sparkling eyes, to view the guilty man;<BR>

Not sprung from noble blood, nor goddess-born,<BR>
But hewn from harden'd entrails of a rock!<BR>
And rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck!<BR>
Why should I fawn? what have I worse to fear?<BR>
Did he once look, or lent a list'ning ear,<BR>
Sigh'd when I sobb'd, or shed one kindly tear?-<BR>
All symptoms of a base ungrateful mind,<BR>
So foul, that, which is worse, 'tis hard to find.<BR>
Of man's injustice why should I complain?<BR>
The gods, and Jove himself, behold in vain<BR>
Triumphant treason; yet no thunder flies,<BR>
Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes;<BR>
Faithless is earth, and faithless are the skies!<BR>
Justice is fled, and Truth is now no more!<BR>
I sav'd the shipwrack'd exile on my shore;<BR>
With needful food his hungry Trojans fed;<BR>
I took the traitor to my throne and bed:<BR>
Fool that I was- 't is little to repeat<BR>
The rest- I stor'd and rigg'd his ruin'd fleet.<BR>
I rave, I rave! A god's command he pleads,<BR>
And makes Heav'n accessary to his deeds.<BR>
Now Lycian lots, and now the Delian god,<BR>
Now Hermes is employ'd from Jove's abode,<BR>
To warn him hence; as if the peaceful state<BR>
Of heav'nly pow'rs were touch'd with human fate!<BR>
But go! thy flight no longer I detain-<BR>
Go seek thy promis'd kingdom thro' the main!<BR>
Yet, if the heav'ns will hear my pious vow,<BR>
The faithless waves, not half so false as thou,<BR>
Or secret sands, shall sepulchers afford<BR>
To thy proud vessels, and their perjur'd lord.<BR>
Then shalt thou call on injur'd Dido's name:<BR>
Dido shall come in a black sulph'ry flame,<BR>
When death has once dissolv'd her mortal frame;<BR>
Shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep:<BR>
Her angry ghost, arising from the deep,<BR>
Shall haunt thee waking, and disturb thy sleep.<BR>
At least my shade thy punishment shall know,<BR>
And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below."<BR>

Strange voices issued from her husband's tomb;<BR>

Hourly 't is heard, when with a boding note<BR>

And beams of early light the heav'ns o'erspread,<BR>
When, from a tow'r, the queen, with wakeful eyes,<BR>
Saw day point upward from the rosy skies.<BR>
She look'd to seaward; but the sea was void,<BR>
And scarce in ken the sailing ships descried.<BR>
Stung with despite, and furious with despair,<BR>
She struck her trembling breast, and tore her hair.<BR>
"And shall th' ungrateful traitor go," she said,<BR>
"My land forsaken, and my love betray'd?<BR>
Shall we not arm? not rush from ev'ry street,<BR>
To follow, sink, and burn his perjur'd fleet?<BR>
Haste, haul my galleys out! pursue the foe!<BR>
Bring flaming brands! set sail, and swiftly row!<BR>
What have I said? where am I? Fury turns<BR>
My brain; and my distemper'd bosom burns.<BR>
Then, when I gave my person and my throne,<BR>
This hate, this rage, had been more timely shown.<BR>
See now the promis'd faith, the vaunted name,<BR>
The pious man, who, rushing thro' the flame,<BR>
Preserv'd his gods, and to the Phrygian shore<BR>
The burthen of his feeble father bore!<BR>
I should have torn him piecemeal; strow'd in floods<BR>
His scatter'd limbs, or left expos'd in woods;<BR>
Destroy'd his friends and son; and, from the fire,<BR>
Have set the reeking boy before the sire.<BR>
Events are doubtful, which on battles wait:<BR>
Yet where's the doubt, to souls secure of fate?<BR>
My Tyrians, at their injur'd queen's command,<BR>
Had toss'd their fires amid the Trojan band;<BR>
At once extinguish'd all the faithless name;<BR>
And I myself, in vengeance of my shame,<BR>
Had fall'n upon the pile, to mend the fun'ral flame.<BR>
Thou Sun, who view'st at once the world below;<BR>
Thou Juno, guardian of the nuptial vow;<BR>
Thou Hecate hearken from thy dark abodes!<BR>
Ye Furies, fiends, and violated gods,<BR>
All pow'rs invok'd with Dido's dying breath,<BR>
Attend her curses and avenge her death!<BR>
If so the Fates ordain, Jove commands,<BR>
Th' ungrateful wretch should find the Latian lands,<BR>
Yet let a race untam'd, and haughty foes,<BR>
His peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose:<BR>
Oppress'd with numbers in th' unequal field,<BR>
His men discourag'd, and himself expell'd,<BR>
Let him for succor sue from place to place,<BR>
Torn from his subjects, and his son's embrace.<BR>
First, let him see his friends in battle slain,<BR>
And their untimely fate lament in vain;<BR>
And when, at length, the cruel war shall cease,<BR>
On hard conditions may he buy his peace:<BR>
Nor let him then enjoy supreme command;<BR>
But fall, untimely, by some hostile hand,<BR>
And lie unburied on the barren sand!<BR>
These are my pray'rs, and this my dying will;<BR>
And you, my Tyrians, ev'ry curse fulfil.<BR>
Perpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim,<BR>
Against the prince, the people, and the name.<BR>
These grateful off'rings on my grave bestow;<BR>
Nor league, nor love, the hostile nations know!<BR>
Now, and from hence, in ev'ry future age,<BR>
When rage excites your arms, and strength supplies the rage<BR>
Rise some avenger of our Libyan blood,<BR>
With fire and sword pursue the perjur'd brood;<BR>
Our arms, our seas, our shores, oppos'd to theirs;<BR>
And the same hate descend on all our heirs!"<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
This said, within her anxious mind she weighs<BR>
The means of cutting short her odious days.<BR>
Then to Sichaeus' nurse she briefly said<BR>
(For, when she left her country, hers was dead):<BR>
"Go, Barce, call my sister. Let her care<BR>
The solemn rites of sacrifice prepare;<BR>
The sheep, and all th' atoning off'rings bring,<BR>
Sprinkling her body from the crystal spring<BR>
With living drops; then let her come, and thou<BR>
With sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow.<BR>
Thus will I pay my vows to Stygian Jove,<BR>
And end the cares of my disastrous love;<BR>
Then cast the Trojan image on the fire,<BR>
And, as that burns, my passions shall expire."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The nurse moves onward, with officious care,<BR>
And all the speed her aged limbs can bear.<BR>
But furious Dido, with dark thoughts involv'd,<BR>
Shook at the mighty mischief she resolv'd.<BR>
With livid spots distinguish'd was her face;<BR>
Red were her rolling eyes, and discompos'd her pace;<BR>
Ghastly she gaz'd, with pain she drew her breath,<BR>
And nature shiver'd at approaching death.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then swiftly to the fatal place she pass'd,<BR>
And mounts the fun'ral pile with furious haste;<BR>
Unsheathes the sword the Trojan left behind<BR>
(Not for so dire an enterprise design'd).<BR>
But when she view'd the garments loosely spread,<BR>
Which once he wore, and saw the conscious bed,<BR>
She paus'd, and with a sigh the robes embrac'd;<BR>
Then on the couch her trembling body cast,<BR>
Repress'd the ready tears, and spoke her last:<BR>
"Dear pledges of my love, while Heav'n so pleas'd,<BR>
Receive a soul, of mortal anguish eas'd:<BR>
My fatal course is finish'd; and I go,<BR>
A glorious name, among the ghosts below.<BR>
A lofty city by my hands is rais'd,<BR>
Pygmalion punish'd, and my lord appeas'd.<BR>
What could my fortune have afforded more,<BR>
Had the false Trojan never touch'd my shore!"<BR>
Then kiss'd the couch; and, "Must I die," she said,<BR>
"And unreveng'd? 'T is doubly to be dead!<BR>
Yet ev'n this death with pleasure I receive:<BR>
On any terms, 't is better than to live.<BR>
These flames, from far, may the false Trojan view;<BR>
These boding omens his base flight pursue!"<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
She said, and struck; deep enter'd in her side<BR>
The piercing steel, with reeking purple dyed:<BR>
Clogg'd in the wound the cruel weapon stands;<BR>
The spouting blood came streaming on her hands.<BR>
Her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke,<BR>
And with loud cries the sounding palace shook.<BR>
Distracted, from the fatal sight they fled,<BR>
And thro' the town the dismal rumor spread.<BR>
First from the frighted court the yell began;<BR>
Redoubled, thence from house to house it ran:<BR>
The groans of men, with shrieks, laments, and cries<BR>
Of mixing women, mount the vaulted skies.<BR>
Not less the clamor, than if- ancient Tyre,<BR>
Or the new Carthage, set by foes on fire-<BR>
The rolling ruin, with their lov'd abodes,<BR>
Involv'd the blazing temples of their gods.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Her sister hears; and, furious with despair,<BR>
She beats her breast, and rends her yellow hair,<BR>
And, calling on Eliza's name aloud,<BR>
Runs breathless to the place, and breaks the crowd.<BR>
"Was all that pomp of woe for this prepar'd;<BR>
These fires, this fun'ral pile, these altars rear'd?<BR>
Was all this train of plots contriv'd," said she,<BR>
"All only to deceive unhappy me?<BR>
Which is the worst? Didst thou in death pretend<BR>
To scorn thy sister, or delude thy friend?<BR>
Thy summon'd sister, and thy friend, had come;<BR>
One sword had serv'd us both, one common tomb:<BR>
Was I to raise the pile, the pow'rs invoke,<BR>
Not to be present at the fatal stroke?<BR>
At once thou hast destroy'd thyself and me,<BR>
Thy town, thy senate, and thy colony!<BR>
Bring water; bathe the wound; while I in death<BR>
Lay close my lips to hers, and catch the flying breath."<BR>
This said, she mounts the pile with eager haste,<BR>
And in her arms the gasping queen embrac'd;<BR>
Her temples chaf'd; and her own garments tore,<BR>
To stanch the streaming blood, and cleanse the gore.<BR>
Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head,<BR>
And, fainting thrice, fell grov'ling on the bed;<BR>
Thrice op'd her heavy eyes, and sought the light,<BR>
But, having found it, sicken'd at the sight,<BR>
And clos'd her lids at last in endless night.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then Juno, grieving that she should sustain<BR>
A death so ling'ring, and so full of pain,<BR>
Sent Iris down, to free her from the strife<BR>
Of lab'ring nature, and dissolve her life.<BR>
For since she died, not doom'd by Heav'n's decree,<BR>
Or her own crime, but human casualty,<BR>
And rage of love, that plung'd her in despair,<BR>
The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair,<BR>
Which Proserpine and they can only know;<BR>
Nor made her sacred to the shades below.<BR>
Downward the various goddess took her flight,<BR>
And drew a thousand colors from the light;<BR>
Then stood above the dying lover's head,<BR>
And said: "I thus devote thee to the dead.<BR>
This off'ring to th' infernal gods I bear."<BR>
Thus while she spoke, she cut the fatal hair:<BR>
The struggling soul was loos'd, and life dissolv'd in air.<BR>

Meantime the Trojan cuts his wat'ry way,<BR>
Fix'd on his voyage, thro' the curling sea;<BR>
Then, casting back his eyes, with dire amaze,<BR>
Sees on the Punic shore the mounting blaze.<BR>
The cause unknown; yet his presaging mind<BR>
The fate of Dido from the fire divin'd;<BR>
He knew the stormy souls of womankind,<BR>
What secret springs their eager passions move,<BR>
How capable of death for injur'd love.<BR>
Dire auguries from hence the Trojans draw;<BR>
Till neither fires nor shining shores they saw.<BR>
Now seas and skies their prospect only bound;<BR>
An empty space above, a floating field around.<BR>
But soon the heav'ns with shadows were o'erspread;<BR>
A swelling cloud hung hov'ring o'er their head:<BR>
Livid it look'd, the threat'ning of a storm:<BR>
Then night and horror ocean's face deform.<BR>
The pilot, Palinurus, cried aloud:<BR>
"What gusts of weather from that gath'ring cloud<BR>
My thoughts presage! Ere yet the tempest roars,<BR>
Stand to your tackle, mates, and stretch your oars;<BR>
Contract your swelling sails, and luff to wind."<BR>
The frighted crew perform the task assign'd.<BR>
Then, to his fearless chief: "Not Heav'n," said he,<BR>
"Tho' Jove himself should promise Italy,<BR>
Can stem the torrent of this raging sea.<BR>
Mark how the shifting winds from west arise,<BR>
And what collected night involves the skies!<BR>
Nor can our shaken vessels live at sea,<BR>
Much less against the tempest force their way.<BR>
'T is fate diverts our course, and fate we must obey.<BR>
Not far from hence, if I observ'd aright<BR>
The southing of the stars, and polar light,<BR>
Sicilia lies, whose hospitable shores<BR>
In safety we may reach with struggling oars."<BR>
Aeneas then replied: "Too sure I find<BR>
We strive in vain against the seas and wind:<BR>
Now shift your sails; what place can please me more<BR>
Than what you promise, the Sicilian shore,<BR>
Whose hallow'd earth Anchises' bones contains,<BR>
And where a prince of Trojan lineage reigns?"<BR>
The course resolv'd, before the western wind<BR>
They scud amain, and make the port assign'd.<BR>
Meantime Acestes, from a lofty stand,<BR>
Beheld the fleet descending on the land;<BR>
And, not unmindful of his ancient race,<BR>
Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace,<BR>
And held the hero in a strict embrace.<BR>
Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore,<BR>
And either hand a pointed jav'lin bore.<BR>
His mother was a dame of Dardan blood;<BR>
His sire Crinisus, a Sicilian flood.<BR>
He welcomes his returning friends ashore<BR>
With plenteous country cates and homely store.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now, when the following morn had chas'd away<BR>
The flying stars, and light restor'd the day,<BR>
Aeneas call'd the Trojan troops around,<BR>
And thus bespoke them from a rising ground:<BR>
"Offspring of heav'n, divine Dardanian race!<BR>
The sun, revolving thro' th' ethereal space,<BR>
The shining circle of the year has fill'd,<BR>
Since first this isle my father's ashes held:<BR>
And now the rising day renews the year;<BR>
A day for ever sad, for ever dear.<BR>
This would I celebrate with annual games,<BR>
With gifts on altars pil'd, and holy flames,<BR>
Tho' banish'd to Gaetulia's barren sands,<BR>
Caught on the Grecian seas, or hostile lands:<BR>
But since this happy storm our fleet has driv'n<BR>
(Not, as I deem, without the will of Heav'n)<BR>
Upon these friendly shores and flow'ry plains,<BR>
Which hide Anchises and his blest remains,<BR>
Let us with joy perform his honors due,<BR>
And pray for prosp'rous winds, our voyage to renew;<BR>
Pray, that in towns and temples of our own,<BR>
The name of great Anchises may be known,<BR>
And yearly games may spread the gods' renown.<BR>
Our sports Acestes, of the Trojan race,<BR>
With royal gifts ordain'd, is pleas'd to grace:<BR>
Two steers on ev'ry ship the king bestows;<BR>
His gods and ours shall share your equal vows.<BR>
Besides, if, nine days hence, the rosy morn<BR>
Shall with unclouded light the skies adorn,<BR>
That day with solemn sports I mean to grace:<BR>
Light galleys on the seas shall run a wat'ry race;<BR>
Some shall in swiftness for the goal contend,<BR>
And others try the twanging bow to bend;<BR>
The strong, with iron gauntlets arm'd, shall stand<BR>
Oppos'd in combat on the yellow sand.<BR>
Let all be present at the games prepar'd,<BR>
And joyful victors wait the just reward.<BR>
But now assist the rites, with garlands crown'd."<BR>
He said, and first his brows with myrtle bound.<BR>
Then Helymus, by his example led,<BR>
And old Acestes, each adorn'd his head;<BR>
Thus young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace,<BR>
His temples tied, and all the Trojan race.<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 0.5em">Aeneas then advanc'd amidst the train,</SPAN><BR>
By thousands follow'd thro' the flow'ry plain,<BR>
To great Anchises' tomb; which when he found,<BR>
He pour'd to Bacchus, on the hallow'd ground,<BR>
Two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more,<BR>
And two (from offer'd bulls) of purple gore,<BR>
With roses then the sepulcher he strow'd<BR>
And thus his father's ghost bespoke aloud:<BR>
"Hail, O ye holy manes! hail again,<BR>
Paternal ashes, now review'd in vain!<BR>
The gods permitted not, that you, with me,<BR>
Should reach the promis'd shores of Italy,<BR>
Or Tiber's flood, what flood soe'er it be."<BR>
Scarce had he finish'd, when, with speckled pride,<BR>
A serpent from the tomb began to glide;<BR>
His hugy bulk on sev'n high volumes roll'd;<BR>
Blue was his breadth of back, but streak'd with scaly gold:<BR>
Thus riding on his curls, he seem'd to pass<BR>
A rolling fire along, and singe the grass.<BR>
More various colors thro' his body run,<BR>
Than Iris when her bow imbibes the sun.<BR>
Betwixt the rising altars, and around,<BR>
The sacred monster shot along the ground;<BR>
With harmless play amidst the bowls he pass'd,<BR>
And with his lolling tongue assay'd the taste:<BR>
Thus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest<BR>
Within the hollow tomb retir'd to rest.<BR>
The pious prince, surpris'd at what he view'd,<BR>
The fun'ral honors with more zeal renew'd,<BR>
Doubtful if this place's genius were,<BR>
Or guardian of his father's sepulcher.<BR>
Five sheep, according to the rites, he slew;<BR>
As many swine, and steers of sable hue;<BR>
New gen'rous wine he from the goblets pour'd.<BR>
And call'd his father's ghost, from hell restor'd.<BR>
The glad attendants in long order come,<BR>
Off'ring their gifts at great Anchises' tomb:<BR>
Some add more oxen: some divide the spoil;<BR>
Some place the chargers on the grassy soil;<BR>
Some blow the fires, and offered entrails broil.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now came the day desir'd. The skies were bright<BR>
With rosy luster of the rising light:<BR>
The bord'ring people, rous'd by sounding fame<BR>
Of Trojan feasts and great Acestes' name,<BR>
The crowded shore with acclamations fill,<BR>
Part to behold, and part to prove their skill.<BR>
And first the gifts in public view they place,<BR>
Green laurel wreaths, and palm, the victors' grace:<BR>
Within the circle, arms and tripods lie,<BR>
Ingots of gold and silver, heap'd on high,<BR>
And vests embroider'd, of the Tyrian dye.<BR>
The trumpet's clangor then the feast proclaims,<BR>
And all prepare for their appointed games.<BR>
Four galleys first, which equal rowers bear,<BR>
Advancing, in the wat'ry lists appear.<BR>
The speedy Dolphin, that outstrips the wind,<BR>
Bore Mnestheus, author of the Memmian kind:<BR>
Gyas the vast Chimaera's bulk commands,<BR>
Which rising, like a tow'ring city stands;<BR>
Three Trojans tug at ev'ry lab'ring oar;<BR>
Three banks in three degrees the sailors bore;<BR>
Beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar.<BR>
Sergesthus, who began the Sergian race,<BR>
In the great Centaur took the leading place;<BR>
Cloanthus on the sea-green Scylla stood,<BR>
From whom Cluentius draws his Trojan blood.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Far in the sea, against the foaming shore,<BR>
There stands a rock: the raging billows roar<BR>
Above his head in storms; but, when 't is clear,<BR>
Uncurl their ridgy backs, and at his foot appear.<BR>
In peace below the gentle waters run;<BR>
The cormorants above lie basking in the sun.<BR>
On this the hero fix'd an oak in sight,<BR>
The mark to guide the mariners aright.<BR>
To bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars;<BR>
Then round the rock they steer, and seek the former shores.<BR>
The lots decide their place. Above the rest,<BR>
Each leader shining in his Tyrian vest;<BR>
The common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs<BR>
Their temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows:<BR>
Besmear'd with oil, their naked shoulders shine.<BR>
All take their seats, and wait the sounding sign:<BR>
They gripe their oars; and ev'ry panting breast<BR>
Is rais'd by turns with hope, by turns with fear depress'd.<BR>
The clangor of the trumpet gives the sign;<BR>
At once they start, advancing in a line:<BR>
With shouts the sailors rend the starry skies;<BR>
Lash'd with their oars, the smoky billows rise;<BR>
Sparkles the briny main, and the vex'd ocean fries.<BR>
Exact in time, with equal strokes they row:<BR>
At once the brushing oars and brazen prow<BR>
Dash up the sandy waves, and ope the depths below.<BR>
Not fiery coursers, in a chariot race,<BR>
Invade the field with half so swift a pace;<BR>
Not the fierce driver with more fury lends<BR>
The sounding lash, and, ere the stroke descends,<BR>
Low to the wheels his pliant body bends.<BR>
The partial crowd their hopes and fears divide,<BR>
And aid with eager shouts the favor'd side.<BR>
Cries, murmurs, clamors, with a mixing sound,<BR>
From woods to woods, from hills to hills rebound.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Amidst the loud applauses of the shore,<BR>
Gyas outstripp'd the rest, and sprung before:<BR>
Cloanthus, better mann'd, pursued him fast,<BR>
But his o'er-masted galley check'd his haste.<BR>
The Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine<BR>
With equal oars, advancing in a line;<BR>
And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead,<BR>
And now the speedy Dolphin gets ahead;<BR>
Now board to board the rival vessels row,<BR>
The billows lave the skies, and ocean groans below.<BR>
They reach'd the mark. Proud Gyas and his train<BR>
In triumph rode, the victors of the main;<BR>
But, steering round, he charg'd his pilot stand<BR>
More close to shore, and skim along the sand-<BR>
"Let others bear to sea!" Menoetes heard;<BR>
But secret shelves too cautiously he fear'd,<BR>
And, fearing, sought the deep; and still aloof he steer'd.<BR>
With louder cries the captain call'd again:<BR>
"Bear to the rocky shore, and shun the main."<BR>
He spoke, and, speaking, at his stern he saw<BR>
The bold Cloanthus near the shelvings draw.<BR>
Betwixt the mark and him the Scylla stood,<BR>
And in a closer compass plow'd the flood.<BR>
He pass'd the mark; and, wheeling, got before:<BR>
Gyas blasphem'd the gods, devoutly swore,<BR>
Cried out for anger, and his hair he tore.<BR>
Mindless of others' lives (so high was grown<BR>
His rising rage) and careless of his own,<BR>
The trembling dotard to the deck he drew;<BR>
Then hoisted up, and overboard he threw:<BR>
This done, he seiz'd the helm; his fellows cheer'd,<BR>
Turn'd short upon the shelfs, and madly steer'd.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Hardly his head the plunging pilot rears,<BR>
Clogg'd with his clothes, and cumber'd with his years:<BR>
Now dropping wet, he climbs the cliff with pain.<BR>
The crowd, that saw him fall and float again,<BR>
Shout from the distant shore; and loudly laugh'd,<BR>
To see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught.<BR>
The following Centaur, and the Dolphin's crew,<BR>
Their vanish'd hopes of victory renew;<BR>
While Gyas lags, they kindle in the race,<BR>
To reach the mark. Sergesthus takes the place;<BR>
Mnestheus pursues; and while around they wind,<BR>
Comes up, not half his galley's length behind;<BR>
Then, on the deck, amidst his mates appear'd,<BR>
And thus their drooping courage he cheer'd:<BR>
"My friends, and Hector's followers heretofore,<BR>
Exert your vigor; tug the lab'ring oar;<BR>
Stretch to your strokes, my still unconquer'd crew,<BR>
Whom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew.<BR>
In this, our common int'rest, let me find<BR>
That strength of hand, that courage of the mind,<BR>
As when you stemm'd the strong Malean flood,<BR>
And o'er the Syrtes' broken billows row'd.<BR>
I seek not now the foremost palm to gain;<BR>
Tho' yet- but, ah! that haughty wish is vain!<BR>
Let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain.<BR>
But to be last, the lags of all the race!-<BR>
Redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace."<BR>
Now, one and all, they tug amain; they row<BR>
At the full stretch, and shake the brazen prow.<BR>
The sea beneath 'em sinks; their lab'ring sides<BR>
Are swell'd, and sweat runs gutt'ring down in tides.<BR>
Chance aids their daring with unhop'd success;<BR>
Sergesthus, eager with his beak to press<BR>
Betwixt the rival galley and the rock,<BR>
Shuts up th' unwieldly Centaur in the lock.<BR>
The vessel struck; and, with the dreadful shock,<BR>
Her oars she shiver'd, and her head she broke.<BR>
The trembling rowers from their banks arise,<BR>
And, anxious for themselves, renounce the prize.<BR>
With iron poles they heave her off the shores,<BR>
And gather from the sea their floating oars.<BR>
The crew of Mnestheus, with elated minds,<BR>
Urge their success, and call the willing winds;<BR>
Then ply their oars, and cut their liquid way<BR>
In larger compass on the roomy sea.<BR>
As, when the dove her rocky hold forsakes,<BR>
Rous'd in a fright, her sounding wings she shakes;<BR>
The cavern rings with clatt'ring; out she flies,<BR>
And leaves her callow care, and cleaves the skies:<BR>
At first she flutters; but at length she springs<BR>
To smoother flight, and shoots upon her wings:<BR>
So Mnestheus in the Dolphin cuts the sea;<BR>
And, flying with a force, that force assists his way.<BR>
Sergesthus in the Centaur soon he pass'd,<BR>
Wedg'd in the rocky shoals, and sticking fast.<BR>
In vain the victor he with cries implores,<BR>
And practices to row with shatter'd oars.<BR>
Then Mnestheus bears with Gyas, and outflies:<BR>
The ship, without a pilot, yields the prize.<BR>
Unvanquish'd Scylla now alone remains;<BR>
Her he pursues, and all his vigor strains.<BR>
Shouts from the fav'ring multitude arise;<BR>
Applauding Echo to the shouts replies;<BR>
Shouts, wishes, and applause run rattling thro' the skies.<BR>
These clamors with disdain the Scylla heard,<BR>
Much grudg'd the praise, but more the robb'd reward:<BR>
Resolv'd to hold their own, they mend their pace,<BR>
All obstinate to die, or gain the race.<BR>
Rais'd with success, the Dolphin swiftly ran;<BR>
For they can conquer, who believe they can.<BR>
Both urge their oars, and fortune both supplies,<BR>
And both perhaps had shar'd an equal prize;<BR>
When to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands,<BR>
And succor from the wat'ry pow'rs demands:<BR>
"Gods of the liquid realms, on which I row!<BR>
If, giv'n by you, the laurel bind my brow,<BR>
Assist to make me guilty of my vow!<BR>
A snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain;<BR>
His offer'd entrails cast into the main,<BR>
And ruddy wine, from golden goblets thrown,<BR>
Your grateful gift and my return shall own."<BR>
The choir of nymphs, and Phorcus, from below,<BR>
With virgin Panopea, heard his vow;<BR>
And old Portunus, with his breadth of hand,<BR>
Push'd on, and sped the galley to the land.<BR>
Swift as a shaft, or winged wind, she flies,<BR>
And, darting to the port, obtains the prize.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The herald summons all, and then proclaims<BR>
Cloanthus conqu'ror of the naval games.<BR>
The prince with laurel crowns the victor's head,<BR>
And three fat steers are to his vessel led,<BR>
The ship's reward; with gen'rous wine beside,<BR>
And sums of silver, which the crew divide.<BR>
The leaders are distinguish'd from the rest;<BR>
The victor honor'd with a nobler vest,<BR>
Where gold and purple strive in equal rows,<BR>
And needlework its happy cost bestows.<BR>
There Ganymede is wrought with living art,<BR>
Chasing thro' Ida's groves the trembling hart:<BR>
Breathless he seems, yet eager to pursue;<BR>
When from aloft descends, in open view,<BR>
The bird of Jove, and, sousing on his prey,<BR>
With crooked talons bears the boy away.<BR>
In vain, with lifted hands and gazing eyes,<BR>
His guards behold him soaring thro' the skies,<BR>
And dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries.<BR>

Yet, loaded thus, Demoleus o'er the plain<BR>
Pursued and lightly seiz'd the Trojan train.<BR>
The third, succeeding to the last reward,<BR>
Two goodly bowls of massy silver shar'd,<BR>
With figures prominent, and richly wrought,<BR>
And two brass caldrons from Dodona brought.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thus all, rewarded by the hero's hands,<BR>
Their conqu'ring temples bound with purple bands;<BR>
And now Sergesthus, clearing from the rock,<BR>
Brought back his galley shatter'd with the shock.<BR>
Forlorn she look'd, without an aiding oar,<BR>
And, houted by the vulgar, made to shore.<BR>
As when a snake, surpris'd upon the road,<BR>
Is crush'd athwart her body by the load<BR>
Of heavy wheels; or with a mortal wound<BR>
Her belly bruis'd, and trodden to the ground:<BR>
In vain, with loosen'd curls, she crawls along;<BR>
Yet, fierce above, she brandishes her tongue;<BR>
Glares with her eyes, and bristles with her scales;<BR>
But, groveling in the dust, her parts unsound she trails:<BR>
So slowly to the port the Centaur tends,<BR>
But, what she wants in oars, with sails amends.<BR>
Yet, for his galley sav'd, the grateful prince<BR>
Is pleas'd th' unhappy chief to recompense.<BR>
Pholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care,<BR>
Beauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
From thence his way the Trojan hero bent<BR>
Into the neighb'ring plain, with mountains pent,<BR>
Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood.<BR>
Full in the midst of this fair valley stood<BR>
A native theater, which, rising slow<BR>
By just degrees, o'erlook'd the ground below.<BR>
High on a sylvan throne the leader sate;<BR>
A num'rous train attend in solemn state.<BR>
Here those that in the rapid course delight,<BR>
Desire of honor and the prize invite.<BR>
The rival runners without order stand;<BR>
The Trojans mix'd with the Sicilian band.<BR>
First Nisus, with Euryalus, appears;<BR>
Euryalus a boy of blooming years,<BR>
With sprightly grace and equal beauty crown'd;<BR>
Nisus, for friendship to the youth renown'd.<BR>
Diores next, of Priam's royal race,<BR>
Then Salius joined with Patron, took their place;<BR>
(But Patron in Arcadia had his birth,<BR>
And Salius his from Arcananian earth;)<BR>
Then two Sicilian youths- the names of these,<BR>
Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes:<BR>
Both jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred,<BR>
And owning old Acestes for their head;<BR>
With sev'ral others of ignobler name,<BR>
Whom time has not deliver'd o'er to fame.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
To these the hero thus his thoughts explain'd,<BR>
In words which gen'ral approbation gain'd:<BR>
"One common largess is for all design'd,<BR>
(The vanquish'd and the victor shall be join'd,)<BR>
Two darts of polish'd steel and Gnosian wood,<BR>
A silver-studded ax, alike bestow'd.<BR>
The foremost three have olive wreaths decreed:<BR>
The first of these obtains a stately steed,<BR>
Adorn'd with trappings; and the next in fame,<BR>
The quiver of an Amazonian dame,<BR>
With feather'd Thracian arrows well supplied:<BR>
A golden belt shall gird his manly side,<BR>
Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied.<BR>
The third this Grecian helmet shall content."<BR>
He said. To their appointed base they went;<BR>
With beating hearts th' expected sign receive,<BR>
And, starting all at once, the barrier leave.<BR>
Spread out, as on the winged winds, they flew,<BR>
And seiz'd the distant goal with greedy view.<BR>
Shot from the crowd, swift Nisus all o'erpass'd;<BR>
Nor storms, nor thunder, equal half his haste.<BR>
The next, but tho' the next, yet far disjoin'd,<BR>
Came Salius, and Euryalus behind;<BR>
Then Helymus, whom young Diores plied,<BR>
Step after step, and almost side by side,<BR>
His shoulders pressing; and, in longer space,<BR>
Had won, or left at least a dubious race.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last,<BR>
When eager Nisus, hapless in his haste,<BR>
Slipp'd first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain,<BR>
Soak'd with the blood of oxen newly slain.<BR>
The careless victor had not mark'd his way;<BR>
But, treading where the treach'rous puddle lay,<BR>
His heels flew up; and on the grassy floor<BR>
He fell, besmear'd with filth and holy gore.<BR>
Not mindless then, Euryalus, of thee,<BR>
Nor of the sacred bonds of amity,<BR>
He strove th' immediate rival's hope to cross,<BR>
And caught the foot of Salius as he rose.<BR>
So Salius lay extended on the plain;<BR>
Euryalus springs out, the prize to gain,<BR>
And leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend<BR>
The victor to the goal, who vanquish'd by his friend.<BR>
Next Helymus; and then Diores came,<BR>
By two misfortunes made the third in fame.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But Salius enters, and, exclaiming loud<BR>
For justice, deafens and disturbs the crowd;<BR>
Urges his cause may in the court be heard;<BR>
And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr'd.<BR>
But favor for Euryalus appears;<BR>
His blooming beauty, with his tender tears,<BR>
Had brib'd the judges for the promis'd prize.<BR>
Besides, Diores fills the court with cries,<BR>
Who vainly reaches at the last reward,<BR>
If the first palm on Salius be conferr'd.<BR>
Then thus the prince: "Let no disputes arise:<BR>
Where fortune plac'd it, I award the prize.<BR>
But fortune's errors give me leave to mend,<BR>
At least to pity my deserving friend."<BR>
He said, and, from among the spoils, he draws<BR>
(Pond'rous with shaggy mane and golden paws)<BR>
A lion's hide: to Salius this he gives.<BR>
Nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves.<BR>
"If such rewards to vanquish'd men are due."<BR>
He said, "and falling is to rise by you,<BR>
What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim,<BR>
Who merited the first rewards and fame?<BR>
In falling, both an equal fortune tried;<BR>
Would fortune for my fall so well provide!"<BR>
With this he pointed to his face, and show'd<BR>
His hand and all his habit smear'd with blood.<BR>
Th' indulgent father of the people smil'd,<BR>
And caus'd to be produc'd an ample shield,<BR>
Of wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought,<BR>
Long since from Neptune's bars in triumph brought.<BR>
This giv'n to Nisus, he divides the rest,<BR>
And equal justice in his gifts express'd.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The race thus ended, and rewards bestow'd,<BR>
Once more the prince bespeaks th' attentive crowd:<BR>
"If there he here whose dauntless courage dare<BR>
In gauntlet-fight, with limbs and body bare,<BR>
His opposite sustain in open view,<BR>
Stand forth the champion, and the games renew.<BR>
Two prizes I propose, and thus divide:<BR>
A bull with gilded horns, and fillets tied,<BR>
Shall be the portion of the conqu'ring chief;<BR>
A sword and helm shall cheer the loser's grief."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then haughty Dares in the lists appears;<BR>
Stalking he strides, his head erected bears:<BR>
His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,<BR>
And loud applauses echo thro' the field.<BR>
Dares alone in combat us'd to stand<BR>
The match of mighty Paris, hand to hand;<BR>
The same, at Hector's fun'rals, undertook<BR>
Gigantic Butes, of th' Amycian stock,<BR>
And, by the stroke of his resistless hand,<BR>
Stretch'd the vast bulk upon the yellow sand.<BR>
Such Dares was; and such he strode along,<BR>
And drew the wonder of the gazing throng.<BR>
His brawny back and ample breast he shows,<BR>
His lifted arms around his head he throws,<BR>
And deals in whistling air his empty blows.<BR>
His match is sought; but, thro' the trembling band,<BR>
Not one dares answer to the proud demand.<BR>
Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes<BR>
Already he devours the promis'd prize.<BR>
He claims the bull with awless insolence,<BR>
And having seiz'd his horns, accosts the prince:<BR>
"If none my matchless valor dares oppose,<BR>
How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes?<BR>
Permit me, chief, permit without delay,<BR>
To lead this uncontended gift away."<BR>
The crowd assents, and with redoubled cries<BR>
For the proud challenger demands the prize.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Acestes, fir'd with just disdain, to see<BR>
The palm usurp'd without a victory,<BR>
Reproach'd Entellus thus, who sate beside,<BR>
And heard and saw, unmov'd, the Trojan's pride:<BR>
"Once, but in vain, a champion of renown,<BR>
So tamely can you bear the ravish'd crown,<BR>
A prize in triumph borne before your sight,<BR>
And shun, for fear, the danger of the fight?<BR>
Where is our Eryx now, the boasted name,<BR>
The god who taught your thund'ring arm the game?<BR>
Where now your baffled honor? Where the spoil<BR>
That fill'd your house, and fame that fill'd our isle?"<BR>
Entellus, thus: "My soul is still the same,<BR>
Unmov'd with fear, and mov'd with martial fame;<BR>
But my chill blood is curdled in my veins,<BR>
And scarce the shadow of a man remains.<BR>
O could I turn to that fair prime again,<BR>
That prime of which this boaster is so vain,<BR>
The brave, who this decrepid age defies,<BR>
Should feel my force, without the promis'd prize."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He said; and, rising at the word, he threw<BR>
Two pond'rous gauntlets down in open view;<BR>
Gauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield,<BR>
And sheathe his hands with in the listed field.<BR>
With fear and wonder seiz'd, the crowd beholds<BR>
The gloves of death, with sev'n distinguish'd folds<BR>
Of tough bull hides; the space within is spread<BR>
With iron, or with loads of heavy lead:<BR>
Dares himself was daunted at the sight,<BR>
Renounc'd his challenge, and refus'd to fight.<BR>
Astonish'd at their weight, the hero stands,<BR>
And pois'd the pond'rous engines in his hands.<BR>
"What had your wonder," said Entellus, "been,<BR>
Had you the gauntlets of Alcides seen,<BR>
Or view'd the stern debate on this unhappy green!<BR>
These which I bear your brother Eryx bore,<BR>
Still mark'd with batter'd brains and mingled gore.<BR>
With these he long sustain'd th' Herculean arm;<BR>
And these I wielded while my blood was warm,<BR>
This languish'd frame while better spirits fed,<BR>
Ere age unstrung my nerves, or time o'ersnow'd my head.<BR>
But if the challenger these arms refuse,<BR>
And cannot wield their weight, or dare not use;<BR>
If great Aeneas and Acestes join<BR>
In his request, these gauntlets I resign;<BR>
Let us with equal arms perform the fight,<BR>
And let him leave to fear, since I resign my right."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
This said, Entellus for the strife prepares;<BR>
Stripp'd of his quilted coat, his body bares;<BR>
Compos'd of mighty bones and brawn he stands,<BR>
A goodly tow'ring object on the sands.<BR>
Then just Aeneas equal arms supplied,<BR>
Which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied.<BR>
Both on the tiptoe stand, at full extent,<BR>
Their arms aloft, their bodies inly bent;<BR>
Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar;<BR>
With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war.<BR>
One on his youth and pliant limbs relies;<BR>
One on his sinews and his giant size.<BR>
The last is stiff with age, his motion slow;<BR>
He heaves for breath, he staggers to and fro,<BR>
And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow.<BR>
Yet equal in success, they ward, they strike;<BR>
Their ways are diff'rent, but their art alike.<BR>
Before, behind, the blows are dealt; around<BR>
Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound.<BR>
A storm of strokes, well meant, with fury flies,<BR>
And errs about their temples, ears, and eyes.<BR>
Nor always errs; for oft the gauntlet draws<BR>
A sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws.<BR>
Heavy with age, Entellus stands his ground,<BR>
But with his warping body wards the wound.<BR>
His hand and watchful eye keep even pace;<BR>
While Dares traverses and shifts his place,<BR>
And, like a captain who beleaguers round<BR>
Some strong-built castle on a rising ground,<BR>
Views all th' approaches with observing eyes:<BR>
This and that other part in vain he tries,<BR>
And more on industry than force relies.<BR>
With hands on high, Entellus threats the foe;<BR>
But Dares watch'd the motion from below,<BR>
And slipp'd aside, and shunn'd the long descending blow.<BR>
Entellus wastes his forces on the wind,<BR>
And, thus deluded of the stroke design'd,<BR>
Headlong and heavy fell; his ample breast<BR>
And weighty limbs his ancient mother press'd.<BR>
So falls a hollow pine, that long had stood<BR>
On Ida's height, or Erymanthus' wood,<BR>
Torn from the roots. The diff'ring nations rise,<BR>
And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies,<BR>
Acestus runs with eager haste, to raise<BR>
The fall'n companion of his youthful days.<BR>
Dauntless he rose, and to the fight return'd;<BR>
With shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn'd.<BR>
Disdain and conscious virtue fir'd his breast,<BR>
And with redoubled force his foe he press'd.<BR>
He lays on load with either hand, amain,<BR>
And headlong drives the Trojan o'er the plain;<BR>
Nor stops, nor stays; nor rest nor breath allows;<BR>
But storms of strokes descend about his brows,<BR>
A rattling tempest, and a hail of blows.<BR>
But now the prince, who saw the wild increase<BR>
Of wounds, commands the combatants to cease,<BR>
And bounds Entellus' wrath, and bids the peace.<BR>
First to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came,<BR>
And sooth'd his sorrow for the suffer'd shame.<BR>
"What fury seiz'd my friend? The gods," said he,<BR>
"To him propitious, and averse to thee,<BR>
Have giv'n his arm superior force to thine.<BR>
'T is madness to contend with strength divine."<BR>
The gauntlet fight thus ended, from the shore<BR>
His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore:<BR>
His mouth and nostrils pour'd a purple flood,<BR>
And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.<BR>
Faintly he stagger'd thro' the hissing throng,<BR>
And hung his head, and trail'd his legs along.<BR>
The sword and casque are carried by his train;<BR>
But with his foe the palm and ox remain.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The champion, then, before Aeneas came,<BR>
Proud of his prize, but prouder of his fame:<BR>
"O goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host,<BR>
Mark with attention, and forgive my boast;<BR>
Learn what I was, by what remains; and know<BR>
From what impending fate you sav'd my foe."<BR>
Sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull;<BR>
And, on his ample forehead aiming full,<BR>
The deadly stroke, descending, pierc'd the skull.<BR>
Down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound,<BR>
But sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground.<BR>
Then, thus: "In Dares' stead I offer this.<BR>
Eryx, accept a nobler sacrifice;<BR>
Take the last gift my wither'd arms can yield:<BR>
Thy gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
This done, Aeneas orders, for the close,<BR>
The strife of archers with contending bows.<BR>
The mast Sergesthus' shatter'd galley bore<BR>
With his own hands he raises on the shore.<BR>
A flutt'ring dove upon the top they tie,<BR>
The living mark at which their arrows fly.<BR>
The rival archers in a line advance,<BR>
Their turn of shooting to receive from chance.<BR>
A helmet holds their names; the lots are drawn:<BR>
On the first scroll was read Hippocoon.<BR>
The people shout. Upon the next was found<BR>
Young Mnestheus, late with naval honors crown'd.<BR>
The third contain'd Eurytion's noble name,<BR>
Thy brother, Pandarus, and next in fame,<BR>
Whom Pallas urg'd the treaty to confound,<BR>
And send among the Greeks a feather'd wound.<BR>
Acestes in the bottom last remain'd,<BR>
Whom not his age from youthful sports restrain'd.<BR>
Soon all with vigor bend their trusty bows,<BR>
And from the quiver each his arrow chose.<BR>
Hippocoon's was the first: with forceful sway<BR>
It flew, and, whizzing, cut the liquid way.<BR>
Fix'd in the mast the feather'd weapon stands:<BR>
The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands,<BR>
And the tree trembled, and the shouting cries<BR>
Of the pleas'd people rend the vaulted skies.<BR>
Then Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove,<BR>
With lifted eyes, and took his aim above,<BR>
But made a glancing shot, and missed the dove;<BR>
Yet miss'd so narrow, that he cut the cord<BR>
Which fasten'd by the foot the flitting bird.<BR>
The captive thus releas'd, away she flies,<BR>
And beats with clapping wings the yielding skies.<BR>
His bow already bent, Eurytion stood;<BR>
And, having first invok'd his brother god,<BR>
His winged shaft with eager haste he sped.<BR>
The fatal message reach'd her as she fled:<BR>
She leaves her life aloft; she strikes the ground,<BR>
And renders back the weapon in the wound.<BR>
Acestes, grudging at his lot, remains,<BR>
Without a prize to gratify his pains.<BR>
Yet, shooting upward, sends his shaft, to show<BR>
An archer's art, and boast his twanging bow.<BR>
The feather'd arrow gave a dire portent,<BR>
And latter augurs judge from this event.<BR>
Chaf'd by the speed, it fir'd; and, as it flew,<BR>
A trail of following flames ascending drew:<BR>
Kindling they mount, and mark the shiny way;<BR>
Across the skies as falling meteors play,<BR>
And vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay.<BR>
The Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare,<BR>
And, trembling, turn their wonder into pray'r.<BR>
The Dardan prince put on a smiling face,<BR>
And strain'd Acestes with a close embrace;<BR>
Then, hon'ring him with gifts above the rest,<BR>
Turn'd the bad omen, nor his fears confess'd.<BR>
"The gods," said he, "this miracle have wrought,<BR>
And order'd you the prize without the lot.<BR>
Accept this goblet, rough with figur'd gold,<BR>
Which Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old:<BR>
This pledge of ancient amity receive,<BR>
Which to my second sire I justly give."<BR>
He said, and, with the trumpets' cheerful sound,<BR>
Proclaim'd him victor, and with laurel-crown'd.<BR>
Nor good Eurytion envied him the prize,<BR>
Tho' he transfix'd the pigeon in the skies.<BR>
Who cut the line, with second gifts was grac'd;<BR>
The third was his whose arrow pierc'd the mast.<BR>

On horseback let him grace his grandsire's day,<BR>

Their chains of burnish'd gold hung down before.<BR>
Three graceful troops they form'd upon the green;<BR>
Three graceful leaders at their head were seen;<BR>
Twelve follow'd ev'ry chief, and left a space between.<BR>
The first young Priam led; a lovely boy,<BR>
Whose grandsire was th' unhappy king of Troy;<BR>
His race in after times was known to fame,<BR>
New honors adding to the Latian name;<BR>
And well the royal boy his Thracian steed became.<BR>

First in the lovely features of his face,<BR>

In three distinguish'd parts, with three distinguish'd guides<BR>
Again they close, and once again disjoin;<BR>
In troop to troop oppos'd, and line to line.<BR>

With harmless rage and well-dissembled war.<BR>
Then in a round the mingled bodies run:<BR>
Flying they follow, and pursuing shun;<BR>
Broken, they break; and, rallying, they renew<BR>

Involv'd the weary feet, without redress,<BR>

In circles, when they swim around the wat'ry race.<BR>

Now cast by fortune on this kindred land,<BR>
What should our rest and rising walls withstand,<BR>
Or hinder here to fix our banish'd band?<BR>
O country lost, and gods redeem'd in vain,<BR>

Time calls you now; the precious hour employ:<BR>
Slack not the good presage, while Heav'n inspires<BR>

His early warriors on his prancing steed,<BR>
And, spurring on, his equals soon o'erpass'd;<BR>
Nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste.<BR>
Soon as the royal youth appear'd in view,<BR>
He sent his voice before him as he flew:<BR>
"What madness moves you, matrons, to destroy<BR>
The last remainders of unhappy Troy!<BR>
Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn,<BR>
And on your friends your fatal fury turn.<BR>
Behold your own Ascanius!" While he said,<BR>
He drew his glitt'ring helmet from his head,<BR>
In which the youths to sportful arms he led.<BR>
By this, Aeneas and his train appear;<BR>
And now the women, seiz'd with shame and fear,<BR>
Dispers'd, to woods and caverns take their flight,<BR>
Abhor their actions, and avoid the light;<BR>
Their friends acknowledge, and their error find,<BR>
And shake the goddess from their alter'd mind.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Not so the raging fires their fury cease,<BR>
But, lurking in the seams, with seeming peace,<BR>
Work on their way amid the smold'ring tow,<BR>
Sure in destruction, but in motion slow.<BR>
The silent plague thro' the green timber eats,<BR>
And vomits out a tardy flame by fits.<BR>
Down to the keels, and upward to the sails,<BR>
The fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails;<BR>
Nor buckets pour'd, nor strength of human hand,<BR>
Can the victorious element withstand.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The pious hero rends his robe, and throws<BR>
To heav'n his hands, and with his hands his vows.<BR>
"O Jove," he cried, "if pray'rs can yet have place;<BR>
If thou abhorr'st not all the Dardan race;<BR>
If any spark of pity still remain;<BR>
If gods are gods, and not invok'd in vain;<BR>
Yet spare the relics of the Trojan train!<BR>
Yet from the flames our burning vessels free,<BR>
Or let thy fury fall alone on me!<BR>
At this devoted head thy thunder throw,<BR>
And send the willing sacrifice below!"<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Scarce had he said, when southern storms arise:<BR>
From pole to pole the forky lightning flies;<BR>
Loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain;<BR>
Heav'n bellies downward, and descends in rain.<BR>
Whole sheets of water from the clouds are sent,<BR>
Which, hissing thro' the planks, the flames prevent,<BR>
And stop the fiery pest. Four ships alone<BR>
Burn to the waist, and for the fleet atone.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
But doubtful thoughts the hero's heart divide;<BR>
If he should still in Sicily reside,<BR>
Forgetful of his fates, or tempt the main,<BR>
In hope the promis'd Italy to gain.<BR>
Then Nautes, old and wise, to whom alone<BR>
The will of Heav'n by Pallas was foreshown;<BR>
Vers'd in portents, experienc'd, and inspir'd<BR>
To tell events, and what the fates requir'd;<BR>
Thus while he stood, to neither part inclin'd,<BR>
With cheerful words reliev'd his lab'ring mind:<BR>
"O goddess-born, resign'd in ev'ry state,<BR>
With patience bear, with prudence push your fate.<BR>
By suff'ring well, our Fortune we subdue;<BR>
Fly when she frowns, and, when she calls, pursue.<BR>
Your friend Acestes is of Trojan kind;<BR>
To him disclose the secrets of your mind:<BR>
Trust in his hands your old and useless train;<BR>
Too num'rous for the ships which yet remain:<BR>
The feeble, old, indulgent of their ease,<BR>
The dames who dread the dangers of the seas,<BR>
With all the dastard crew, who dare not stand<BR>
The shock of battle with your foes by land.<BR>
Here you may build a common town for all,<BR>
And, from Acestes' name, Acesta call."<BR>
The reasons, with his friend's experience join'd,<BR>
Encourag'd much, but more disturb'd his mind.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
'T was dead of night; when to his slumb'ring eyes<BR>
His father's shade descended from the skies,<BR>
And thus he spoke: "O more than vital breath,<BR>
Lov'd while I liv'd, and dear ev'n after death;<BR>
O son, in various toils and troubles toss'd,<BR>
The King of Heav'n employs my careful ghost<BR>
On his commands: the god, who sav'd from fire<BR>
Your flaming fleet, and heard your just desire.<BR>
The wholesome counsel of your friend receive,<BR>
And here the coward train and woman leave:<BR>
The chosen youth, and those who nobly dare,<BR>
Transport, to tempt the dangers of the war.<BR>
The stern Italians will their courage try;<BR>
Rough are their manners, and their minds are high.<BR>
But first to Pluto's palace you shall go,<BR>
And seek my shade among the blest below:<BR>
For not with impious ghosts my soul remains,<BR>
Nor suffers with the damn'd perpetual pains,<BR>
But breathes the living air of soft Elysian plains.<BR>
The chaste Sibylla shall your steps convey,<BR>
And blood of offer'd victims free the way.<BR>
There shall you know what realms the gods assign,<BR>
And learn the fates and fortunes of your line.<BR>
But now, farewell! I vanish with the night,<BR>
And feel the blast of heav'n's approaching light."<BR>
He said, and mix'd with shades, and took his airy flight.<BR>
"Whither so fast?" the filial duty cried;<BR>
"And why, ah why, the wish'd embrace denied?"<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
He said, and rose; as holy zeal inspires,<BR>
He rakes hot embers, and renews the fires;<BR>
His country gods and Vesta then adores<BR>
With cakes and incense, and their aid implores.<BR>
Next, for his friends and royal host he sent,<BR>
Reveal'd his vision, and the gods' intent,<BR>
With his own purpose. All, without delay,<BR>
The will of Jove, and his desires obey.<BR>
They list with women each degenerate name,<BR>
Who dares not hazard life for future fame.<BR>
These they cashier: the brave remaining few,<BR>
Oars, banks, and cables, half consum'd, renew.<BR>
The prince designs a city with the plow;<BR>
The lots their sev'ral tenements allow.<BR>
This part is nam'd from Ilium, that from Troy,<BR>
And the new king ascends the throne with joy;<BR>
A chosen senate from the people draws;<BR>
Appoints the judges, and ordains the laws.<BR>
Then, on the top of Eryx, they begin<BR>
A rising temple to the Paphian queen.<BR>
Anchises, last, is honor'd as a god;<BR>
A priest is added, annual gifts bestow'd,<BR>
And groves are planted round his blest abode.<BR>
Nine days they pass in feasts, their temples crown'd;<BR>
And fumes of incense in the fanes abound.<BR>
Then from the south arose a gentle breeze<BR>
That curl'd the smoothness of the glassy seas;<BR>
The rising winds a ruffling gale afford,<BR>
And call the merry mariners aboard.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now loud laments along the shores resound,<BR>
Of parting friends in close embraces bound.<BR>
The trembling women, the degenerate train,<BR>
Who shunn'd the frightful dangers of the main,<BR>
Ev'n those desire to sail, and take their share<BR>
Of the rough passage and the promis'd war:<BR>
Whom good Aeneas cheers, and recommends<BR>
To their new master's care his fearful friends.<BR>
On Eryx's altars three fat calves he lays;<BR>
A lamb new-fallen to the stormy seas;<BR>
Then slips his haulsers, and his anchors weighs.<BR>
High on the deck the godlike hero stands,<BR>
With olive crown'd, a charger in his hands;<BR>
Then cast the reeking entrails in the brine,<BR>
And pour'd the sacrifice of purple wine.<BR>
Fresh gales arise; with equal strokes they vie,<BR>
And brush the buxom seas, and o'er the billows fly.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Meantime the mother goddess, full of fears,<BR>
To Neptune thus address'd, with tender tears:<BR>
"The pride of Jove's imperious queen, the rage,<BR>
The malice which no suff'rings can assuage,<BR>
Compel me to these pray'rs; since neither fate,<BR>
Nor time, nor pity, can remove her hate:<BR>
Ev'n Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife;<BR>
Still vanquish'd, yet she still renews the strife.<BR>
As if 't were little to consume the town<BR>
Which aw'd the world, and wore th' imperial crown,<BR>
She prosecutes the ghost of Troy with pains,<BR>
And gnaws, ev'n to the bones, the last remains.<BR>
Let her the causes of her hatred tell;<BR>
But you can witness its effects too well.<BR>
You saw the storm she rais'd on Libyan floods,<BR>
That mix'd the mounting billows with the clouds;<BR>
When, bribing Aeolus, she shook the main,<BR>
And mov'd rebellion in your wat'ry reign.<BR>
With fury she possess'd the Dardan dames,<BR>
To burn their fleet with execrable flames,<BR>
And forc'd Aeneas, when his ships were lost,<BR>
To leave his foll'wers on a foreign coast.<BR>
For what remains, your godhead I implore,<BR>
And trust my son to your protecting pow'r.<BR>
If neither Jove's nor Fate's decree withstand,<BR>
Secure his passage to the Latian land."<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then thus the mighty Ruler of the Main:<BR>
"What may not Venus hope from Neptune's reign?<BR>
My kingdom claims your birth; my late defense<BR>
Of your indanger'd fleet may claim your confidence.<BR>
Nor less by land than sea my deeds declare<BR>
How much your lov'd Aeneas is my care.<BR>
Thee, Xanthus, and thee, Simois, I attest.<BR>
Your Trojan troops when proud Achilles press'd,<BR>
And drove before him headlong on the plain,<BR>
And dash'd against the walls the trembling train;<BR>
When floods were fill'd with bodies of the slain;<BR>
When crimson Xanthus, doubtful of his way,<BR>
Stood up on ridges to behold the sea;<BR>
(New heaps came tumbling in, and chok'd his way;)<BR>
When your Aeneas fought, but fought with odds<BR>
Of force unequal, and unequal gods;<BR>
I spread a cloud before the victor's sight,<BR>
Sustain'd the vanquish'd, and secur'd his flight;<BR>
Ev'n then secur'd him, when I sought with joy<BR>
The vow'd destruction of ungrateful Troy.<BR>
My will's the same: fair goddess, fear no more,<BR>
Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore;<BR>
Their lives are giv'n; one destin'd head alone<BR>
Shall perish, and for multitudes atone."<BR>
Thus having arm'd with hopes her anxious mind,<BR>
His finny team Saturnian Neptune join'd,<BR>
Then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws,<BR>
And to the loosen'd reins permits the laws.<BR>
High on the waves his azure car he guides;<BR>
Its axles thunder, and the sea subsides,<BR>
And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides.<BR>
The tempests fly before their father's face,<BR>
Trains of inferior gods his triumph grace,<BR>
And monster whales before their master play,<BR>
And choirs of Tritons crowd the wat'ry way.<BR>
The marshal'd pow'rs in equal troops divide<BR>
To right and left; the gods his better side<BR>
Inclose, and on the worse the Nymphs and Nereids ride.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now smiling hope, with sweet vicissitude,<BR>
Within the hero's mind his joys renew'd.<BR>
He calls to raise the masts, the sheets display;<BR>
The cheerful crew with diligence obey;<BR>
They scud before the wind, and sail in open sea.<BR>
Ahead of all the master pilot steers;<BR>
And, as he leads, the following navy veers.<BR>
The steeds of Night had travel'd half the sky,<BR>
The drowsy rowers on their benches lie,<BR>
When the soft God of Sleep, with easy flight,<BR>
Descends, and draws behind a trail of light.<BR>
Thou, Palinurus, art his destin'd prey;<BR>
To thee alone he takes his fatal way.<BR>
Dire dreams to thee, and iron sleep, he bears;<BR>
And, lighting on thy prow, the form of Phorbas wears.<BR>
Then thus the traitor god began his tale:<BR>
"The winds, my friend, inspire a pleasing gale;<BR>
The ships, without thy care, securely sail.<BR>
Now steal an hour of sweet repose; and I<BR>
Will take the rudder and thy room supply."<BR>
To whom the yawning pilot, half asleep:<BR>
"Me dost thou bid to trust the treach'rous deep,<BR>
The harlot smiles of her dissembling face,<BR>
And to her faith commit the Trojan race?<BR>
Shall I believe the Siren South again,<BR>
And, oft betray'd, not know the monster main?"<BR>
He said: his fasten'd hands the rudder keep,<BR>
And, fix'd on heav'n, his eyes repel invading sleep.<BR>
The god was wroth, and at his temples threw<BR>
A branch in Lethe dipp'd, and drunk with Stygian dew:<BR>
The pilot, vanquish'd by the pow'r divine,<BR>
Soon clos'd his swimming eyes, and lay supine.<BR>
Scarce were his limbs extended at their length,<BR>
The god, insulting with superior strength,<BR>
Fell heavy on him, plung'd him in the sea,<BR>
And, with the stern, the rudder tore away.<BR>
Headlong he fell, and, struggling in the main,<BR>
Cried out for helping hands, but cried in vain.<BR>
The victor daemon mounts obscure in air,<BR>
While the ship sails without the pilot's care.<BR>
On Neptune's faith the floating fleet relies;<BR>
But what the man forsook, the god supplies,<BR>
And o'er the dang'rous deep secure the navy flies;<BR>
Glides by the Sirens' cliffs, a shelfy coast,<BR>
Long infamous for ships and sailors lost,<BR>
And white with bones. Th' impetuous ocean roars,<BR>
And rocks rebellow from the sounding shores.<BR>
The watchful hero felt the knocks, and found<BR>
The tossing vessel sail'd on shoaly ground.<BR>
Sure of his pilot's loss, he takes himself<BR>
The helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf.<BR>
Inly he griev'd, and, groaning from the breast,<BR>
Deplor'd his death; and thus his pain express'd:<BR>
"For faith repos'd on seas, and on the flatt'ring sky,<BR>
Thy naked corpse is doom'd on shores unknown to lie."<BR>

He said, and wept; then spread his sails before<BR>
The winds, and reach'd at length the Cumaean shore:<BR>
Their anchors dropp'd, his crew the vessels moor.<BR>
They turn their heads to sea, their sterns to land,<BR>
And greet with greedy joy th' Italian strand.<BR>
Some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed;<BR>
Some gather sticks, the kindled flames to feed,<BR>
Or search for hollow trees, and fell the woods,<BR>
Or trace thro' valleys the discover'd floods.<BR>
Thus, while their sev'ral charges they fulfil,<BR>
The pious prince ascends the sacred hill<BR>
Where Phoebus is ador'd; and seeks the shade<BR>
Which hides from sight his venerable maid.<BR>
Deep in a cave the Sibyl makes abode;<BR>
Thence full of fate returns, and of the god.<BR>
Thro' Trivia's grove they walk; and now behold,<BR>
And enter now, the temple roof'd with gold.<BR>
When Daedalus, to fly the Cretan shore,<BR>
His heavy limbs on jointed pinions bore,<BR>
(The first who sail'd in air,) 't is sung by Fame,<BR>
To the Cumaean coast at length he came,<BR>
And here alighting, built this costly frame.<BR>
Inscrib'd to Phoebus, here he hung on high<BR>
The steerage of his wings, that cut the sky:<BR>
Then o'er the lofty gate his art emboss'd<BR>
Androgeos' death, and off'rings to his ghost;<BR>
Sev'n youths from Athens yearly sent, to meet<BR>
The fate appointed by revengeful Crete.<BR>
And next to those the dreadful urn was plac'd,<BR>
In which the destin'd names by lots were cast:<BR>
The mournful parents stand around in tears,<BR>
And rising Crete against their shore appears.<BR>
There too, in living sculpture, might be seen<BR>
The mad affection of the Cretan queen;<BR>
Then how she cheats her bellowing lover's eye;<BR>
The rushing leap, the doubtful progeny,<BR>
The lower part a beast, a man above,<BR>
The monument of their polluted love.<BR>
Not far from thence he grav'd the wondrous maze,<BR>
A thousand doors, a thousand winding ways:<BR>
Here dwells the monster, hid from human view,<BR>
Not to be found, but by the faithful clew;<BR>
Till the kind artist, mov'd with pious grief,<BR>
Lent to the loving maid this last relief,<BR>
And all those erring paths describ'd so well<BR>
That Theseus conquer'd and the monster fell.<BR>
Here hapless Icarus had found his part,<BR>
Had not the father's grief restrain'd his art.<BR>
He twice assay'd to cast his son in gold;<BR>
Twice from his hands he dropp'd the forming mold.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
All this with wond'ring eyes Aeneas view'd;<BR>
Each varying object his delight renew'd:<BR>
Eager to read the rest- Achates came,<BR>
And by his side the mad divining dame,<BR>
The priestess of the god, Deiphobe her name.<BR>
"Time suffers not," she said, "to feed your eyes<BR>
With empty pleasures; haste the sacrifice.<BR>
Sev'n bullocks, yet unyok'd, for Phoebus choose,<BR>
And for Diana sev'n unspotted ewes."<BR>
This said, the servants urge the sacred rites,<BR>
While to the temple she the prince invites.<BR>
A spacious cave, within its farmost part,<BR>
Was hew'd and fashion'd by laborious art<BR>
Thro' the hill's hollow sides: before the place,<BR>
A hundred doors a hundred entries grace;<BR>
As many voices issue, and the sound<BR>
Of Sybil's words as many times rebound.<BR>
Now to the mouth they come. Aloud she cries:<BR>
"This is the time; enquire your destinies.<BR>
He comes; behold the god!" Thus while she said,<BR>
(And shiv'ring at the sacred entry stay'd,)<BR>
Her color chang'd; her face was not the same,<BR>
And hollow groans from her deep spirit came.<BR>
Her hair stood up; convulsive rage possess'd<BR>
Her trembling limbs, and heav'd her lab'ring breast.<BR>
Greater than humankind she seem'd to look,<BR>
And with an accent more than mortal spoke.<BR>
Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll;<BR>
When all the god came rushing on her soul.<BR>
Swiftly she turn'd, and, foaming as she spoke:<BR>
"Why this delay?" she cried- "the pow'rs invoke!<BR>
Thy pray'rs alone can open this abode;<BR>
Else vain are my demands, and dumb the god."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
She said no more. The trembling Trojans hear,<BR>
O'erspread with a damp sweat and holy fear.<BR>
The prince himself, with awful dread possess'd,<BR>
His vows to great Apollo thus address'd:<BR>
"Indulgent god, propitious pow'r to Troy,<BR>
Swift to relieve, unwilling to destroy,<BR>
Directed by whose hand the Dardan dart<BR>
Pierc'd the proud Grecian's only mortal part:<BR>
Thus far, by fate's decrees and thy commands,<BR>
Thro' ambient seas and thro' devouring sands,<BR>
Our exil'd crew has sought th' Ausonian ground;<BR>
And now, at length, the flying coast is found.<BR>
Thus far the fate of Troy, from place to place,<BR>
With fury has pursued her wand'ring race.<BR>
Here cease, ye pow'rs, and let your vengeance end:<BR>
Troy is no more, and can no more offend.<BR>
And thou, O sacred maid, inspir'd to see<BR>
Th' event of things in dark futurity;<BR>
Give me what Heav'n has promis'd to my fate,<BR>
To conquer and command the Latian state;<BR>
To fix my wand'ring gods, and find a place<BR>
For the long exiles of the Trojan race.<BR>
Then shall my grateful hands a temple rear<BR>
To the twin gods, with vows and solemn pray'r;<BR>
And annual rites, and festivals, and games,<BR>
Shall be perform'd to their auspicious names.<BR>
Nor shalt thou want thy honors in my land;<BR>
For there thy faithful oracles shall stand,<BR>
Preserv'd in shrines; and ev'ry sacred lay,<BR>
Which, by thy mouth, Apollo shall convey:<BR>
All shall be treasur'd by a chosen train<BR>
Of holy priests, and ever shall remain.<BR>
But O! commit not thy prophetic mind<BR>
To flitting leaves, the sport of ev'ry wind,<BR>
Lest they disperse in air our empty fate;<BR>
Write not, but, what the pow'rs ordain, relate."<BR>

Struggling in vain, impatient of her load,<BR>
And lab'ring underneath the pond'rous god,<BR>
The more she strove to shake him from her breast,<BR>
With more and far superior force he press'd;<BR>
Commands his entrance, and, without control,<BR>
Usurps her organs and inspires her soul.<BR>
Now, with a furious blast, the hundred doors<BR>
Ope of themselves; a rushing whirlwind roars<BR>
Within the cave, and Sibyl's voice restores:<BR>
"Escap'd the dangers of the wat'ry reign,<BR>
Yet more and greater ills by land remain.<BR>
The coast, so long desir'd (nor doubt th' event),<BR>
Thy troops shall reach, but, having reach'd, repent.<BR>
Wars, horrid wars, I view- a field of blood,<BR>
And Tiber rolling with a purple flood.<BR>
Simois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there:<BR>
A new Achilles shall in arms appear,<BR>
And he, too, goddess-born. Fierce Juno's hate,<BR>
Added to hostile force, shall urge thy fate.<BR>
To what strange nations shalt not thou resort,<BR>
Driv'n to solicit aid at ev'ry court!<BR>
The cause the same which Ilium once oppress'd;<BR>
A foreign mistress, and a foreign guest.<BR>
But thou, secure of soul, unbent with woes,<BR>
The more thy fortune frowns, the more oppose.<BR>
The dawnings of thy safety shall be shown<BR>
From whence thou least shalt hope, a Grecian town."<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thus, from the dark recess, the Sibyl spoke,<BR>
And the resisting air the thunder broke;<BR>
The cave rebellow'd, and the temple shook.<BR>
Th' ambiguous god, who rul'd her lab'ring breast,<BR>
In these mysterious words his mind express'd;<BR>
Some truths reveal'd, in terms involv'd the rest.<BR>
At length her fury fell, her foaming ceas'd,<BR>
And, ebbing in her soul, the god decreas'd.<BR>
Then thus the chief: "No terror to my view,<BR>
No frightful face of danger can be new.<BR>
Inur'd to suffer, and resolv'd to dare,<BR>
The Fates, without my pow'r, shall be without my care.<BR>
This let me crave, since near your grove the road<BR>
To hell lies open, and the dark abode<BR>
Which Acheron surrounds, th' innavigable flood;<BR>
Conduct me thro' the regions void of light,<BR>
And lead me longing to my father's sight.<BR>
For him, a thousand dangers I have sought,<BR>
And, rushing where the thickest Grecians fought,<BR>
Safe on my back the sacred burthen brought.<BR>
He, for my sake, the raging ocean tried,<BR>
And wrath of Heav'n, my still auspicious guide,<BR>
And bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied.<BR>
Oft, since he breath'd his last, in dead of night<BR>
His reverend image stood before my sight;<BR>
Enjoin'd to seek, below, his holy shade;<BR>
Conducted there by your unerring aid.<BR>
But you, if pious minds by pray'rs are won,<BR>
Oblige the father, and protect the son.<BR>
Yours is the pow'r; nor Proserpine in vain<BR>
Has made you priestess of her nightly reign.<BR>
If Orpheus, arm'd with his enchanting lyre,<BR>
The ruthless king with pity could inspire,<BR>
And from the shades below redeem his wife;<BR>
If Pollux, off'ring his alternate life,<BR>
Could free his brother, and can daily go<BR>
By turns aloft, by turns descend below-<BR>
Why name I Theseus, or his greater friend,<BR>
Who trod the downward path, and upward could ascend?<BR>
Not less than theirs from Jove my lineage came;<BR>
My mother greater, my descent the same."<BR>
So pray'd the Trojan prince, and, while he pray'd,<BR>
His hand upon the holy altar laid.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then thus replied the prophetess divine:<BR>
"O goddess-born of great Anchises' line,<BR>
The gates of hell are open night and day;<BR>
Smooth the descent, and easy is the way:<BR>
But to return, and view the cheerful skies,<BR>
In this the task and mighty labor lies.<BR>
To few great Jupiter imparts this grace,<BR>
And those of shining worth and heav'nly race.<BR>
Betwixt those regions and our upper light,<BR>
Deep forests and impenetrable night<BR>
Possess the middle space: th' infernal bounds<BR>
Cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds.<BR>
But if so dire a love your soul invades,<BR>
As twice below to view the trembling shades;<BR>
If you so hard a toil will undertake,<BR>
As twice to pass th' innavigable lake;<BR>
Receive my counsel. In the neighb'ring grove<BR>
There stands a tree; the queen of Stygian Jove<BR>
Claims it her own; thick woods and gloomy night<BR>
Conceal the happy plant from human sight.<BR>
One bough it bears; but (wondrous to behold!)<BR>
The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold:<BR>
This from the vulgar branches must be torn,<BR>
And to fair Proserpine the present borne,<BR>
Ere leave be giv'n to tempt the nether skies.<BR>
The first thus rent a second will arise,<BR>
And the same metal the same room supplies.<BR>
Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see<BR>
The lurking gold upon the fatal tree:<BR>
Then rend it off, as holy rites command;<BR>
The willing metal will obey thy hand,<BR>
Following with ease, if favor'd by thy fate,<BR>
Thou art foredoom'd to view the Stygian state:<BR>
If not, no labor can the tree constrain;<BR>
And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain.<BR>
Besides, you know not, while you here attend,<BR>
Th' unworthy fate of your unhappy friend:<BR>
Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost,<BR>
Depriv'd of fun'ral rites, pollutes your host.<BR>
Pay first his pious dues; and, for the dead,<BR>
Two sable sheep around his hearse be led;<BR>
Then, living turfs upon his body lay:<BR>
This done, securely take the destin'd way,<BR>
To find the regions destitute of day."<BR>

She said, and held her peace. Aeneas went<BR>
Sad from the cave, and full of discontent,<BR>
Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant.<BR>
Achates, the companion of his breast,<BR>
Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppress'd.<BR>
Walking, they talk'd, and fruitlessly divin'd<BR>
What friend the priestess by those words design'd.<BR>
But soon they found an object to deplore:<BR>
Misenus lay extended on the shore;<BR>
Son of the God of Winds: none so renown'd<BR>
The warrior trumpet in the field to sound;<BR>
With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms,<BR>
And rouse to dare their fate in honorable arms.<BR>
He serv'd great Hector, and was ever near,<BR>
Not with his trumpet only, but his spear.<BR>
But by Pelides' arms when Hector fell,<BR>
He chose Aeneas; and he chose as well.<BR>
Swoln with applause, and aiming still at more,<BR>
He now provokes the sea gods from the shore;<BR>
With envy Triton heard the martial sound,<BR>
And the bold champion, for his challenge, drown'd;<BR>
Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand:<BR>
The gazing crowd around the body stand.<BR>
All weep; but most Aeneas mourns his fate,<BR>
And hastens to perform the funeral state.<BR>
In altar-wise, a stately pile they rear;<BR>
The basis broad below, and top advanc'd in air.<BR>
An ancient wood, fit for the work design'd,<BR>
(The shady covert of the salvage kind,)<BR>
The Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied;<BR>
Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow'ring pride<BR>
Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke,<BR>
And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.<BR>
Huge trunks of trees, fell'd from the steepy crown<BR>
Of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down.<BR>
Arm'd like the rest the Trojan prince appears,<BR>
And by his pious labor urges theirs.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thus while he wrought, revolving in his mind<BR>
The ways to compass what his wish design'd,<BR>
He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove,<BR>
And then with vows implor'd the Queen of Love:<BR>
"O may thy pow'r, propitious still to me,<BR>
Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree,<BR>
In this deep forest; since the Sibyl's breath<BR>
Foretold, alas! too true, Misenus' death."<BR>
Scarce had he said, when, full before his sight,<BR>
Two doves, descending from their airy flight,<BR>
Secure upon the grassy plain alight.<BR>
He knew his mother's birds; and thus he pray'd:<BR>
"Be you my guides, with your auspicious aid,<BR>
And lead my footsteps, till the branch be found,<BR>
Whose glitt'ring shadow gilds the sacred ground.<BR>
And thou, great parent, with celestial care,<BR>
In this distress be present to my pray'r!"<BR>
Thus having said, he stopp'd with watchful sight,<BR>
Observing still the motions of their flight,<BR>
What course they took, what happy signs they shew.<BR>
They fed, and, flutt'ring, by degrees withdrew<BR>
Still farther from the place, but still in view:<BR>
Hopping and flying, thus they led him on<BR>
To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun<BR>
They wing'd their flight aloft; then, stooping low,<BR>
Perch'd on the double tree that bears the golden bough.<BR>
Thro' the green leafs the glitt'ring shadows glow;<BR>
As, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe,<BR>
Where the proud mother views her precious brood,<BR>
And happier branches, which she never sow'd.<BR>
Such was the glitt'ring; such the ruddy rind,<BR>
And dancing leaves, that wanton'd in the wind.<BR>
He seiz'd the shining bough with griping hold,<BR>
And rent away, with ease, the ling'ring gold;<BR>
Then to the Sibyl's palace bore the prize.<BR>
Meantime the Trojan troops, with weeping eyes,<BR>
To dead Misenus pay his obsequies.<BR>
First, from the ground a lofty pile they rear,<BR>
Of pitch trees, oaks, and pines, and unctuous fir:<BR>
The fabric's front with cypress twigs they strew,<BR>
And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew.<BR>
The topmost part his glitt'ring arms adorn;<BR>
Warm waters, then, in brazen caldrons borne,<BR>
Are pour'd to wash his body, joint by joint,<BR>
And fragrant oils the stiffen'd limbs anoint.<BR>
With groans and cries Misenus they deplore:<BR>
Then on a bier, with purple cover'd o'er,<BR>
The breathless body, thus bewail'd, they lay,<BR>
And fire the pile, their faces turn'd away-<BR>
Such reverend rites their fathers us'd to pay.<BR>
Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw,<BR>
And fat of victims, which his friends bestow.<BR>
These gifts the greedy flames to dust devour;<BR>
Then on the living coals red wine they pour;<BR>
And, last, the relics by themselves dispose,<BR>
Which in a brazen urn the priests inclose.<BR>
Old Corynaeus compass'd thrice the crew,<BR>
And dipp'd an olive branch in holy dew;<BR>
Which thrice he sprinkled round, and thrice aloud<BR>
Invok'd the dead, and then dismissed the crowd.<BR>
But good Aeneas order'd on the shore<BR>
A stately tomb, whose top a trumpet bore,<BR>
A soldier's fauchion, and a seaman's oar.<BR>
Thus was his friend interr'd; and deathless fame<BR>
Still to the lofty cape consigns his name.<BR>
These rites perform'd, the prince, without delay,<BR>
Hastes to the nether world his destin'd way.<BR>
Deep was the cave; and, downward as it went<BR>
From the wide mouth, a rocky rough descent;<BR>
And here th' access a gloomy grove defends,<BR>
And there th' unnavigable lake extends,<BR>
O'er whose unhappy waters, void of light,<BR>
No bird presumes to steer his airy flight;<BR>
Such deadly stenches from the depths arise,<BR>
And steaming sulphur, that infects the skies.<BR>
From hence the Grecian bards their legends make,<BR>
And give the name Avernus to the lake.<BR>
Four sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught,<BR>
For sacrifice the pious hero brought.<BR>
The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns;<BR>
Then cuts the curling hair; that first oblation burns,<BR>
Invoking Hecate hither to repair:<BR>
A pow'rful name in hell and upper air.<BR>
The sacred priests with ready knives bereave<BR>
The beasts of life, and in full bowls receive<BR>
The streaming blood: a lamb to Hell and Night<BR>
(The sable wool without a streak of white)<BR>
Aeneas offers; and, by fate's decree,<BR>
A barren heifer, Proserpine, to thee,<BR>
With holocausts he Pluto's altar fills;<BR>
Sev'n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills;<BR>
Then on the broiling entrails oil he pours;<BR>
Which, ointed thus, the raging flame devours.<BR>
Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun,<BR>
Nor ended till the next returning sun.<BR>
Then earth began to bellow, trees to dance,<BR>
And howling dogs in glimm'ring light advance,<BR>
Ere Hecate came. "Far hence be souls profane!"<BR>
The Sibyl cried, "and from the grove abstain!<BR>
Now, Trojan, take the way thy fates afford;<BR>
Assume thy courage, and unsheathe thy sword."<BR>
She said, and pass'd along the gloomy space;<BR>
The prince pursued her steps with equal pace.<BR>

He spreads his canvas; with his pole he steers;<BR>
The freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom bears.<BR>
He look'd in years; yet in his years were seen<BR>
A youthful vigor and autumnal green.<BR>
An airy crowd came rushing where he stood,<BR>
Which fill'd the margin of the fatal flood:<BR>
Husbands and wives, boys and unmarried maids,<BR>
And mighty heroes' more majestic shades,<BR>
And youths, intomb'd before their fathers' eyes,<BR>
With hollow groans, and shrieks, and feeble cries.<BR>
Thick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods,<BR>
Or fowls, by winter forc'd, forsake the floods,<BR>
And wing their hasty flight to happier lands;<BR>
Such, and so thick, the shiv'ring army stands,<BR>
And press for passage with extended hands.<BR>
Now these, now those, the surly boatman bore:<BR>
The rest he drove to distance from the shore.<BR>

The Trojan chief his forward pace repress'd,<BR>
Revolving anxious thoughts within his breast,<BR>

Amidst the spirits, Palinurus press'd,<BR>
Yet fresh from life, a new-admitted guest,<BR>
Who, while he steering view'd the stars, and bore<BR>
His course from Afric to the Latian shore,<BR>
Fell headlong down. The Trojan fix'd his view,<BR>
And scarcely thro' the gloom the sullen shadow knew.<BR>
Then thus the prince: "What envious pow'r, O friend,<BR>
Brought your lov'd life to this disastrous end?<BR>
For Phoebus, ever true in all he said,<BR>
Has in your fate alone my faith betray'd.<BR>
The god foretold you should not die, before<BR>
You reach'd, secure from seas, th' Italian shore.<BR>
Is this th' unerring pow'r?" The ghost replied;<BR>
"Nor Phoebus flatter'd, nor his answers lied;<BR>
Nor envious gods have sent me to the deep:<BR>
But, while the stars and course of heav'n I keep,<BR>
My wearied eyes were seiz'd with fatal sleep.<BR>
I fell; and, with my weight, the helm constrain'd<BR>
Was drawn along, which yet my gripe retain'd.<BR>
Now by the winds and raging waves I swear,<BR>
Your safety, more than mine, was then my care;<BR>
Lest, of the guide bereft, the rudder lost,<BR>
Your ship should run against the rocky coast.<BR>
Three blust'ring nights, borne by the southern blast,<BR>
I floated, and discover'd land at last:<BR>
High on a mounting wave my head I bore,<BR>
Forcing my strength, and gath'ring to the shore.<BR>
Panting, but past the danger, now I seiz'd<BR>
The craggy cliffs, and my tir'd members eas'd.<BR>
While, cumber'd with my dropping clothes, I lay,<BR>
The cruel nation, covetous of prey,<BR>
Stain'd with my blood th' unhospitable coast;<BR>
And now, by winds and waves, my lifeless limbs are toss'd:<BR>
Which O avert, by yon ethereal light,<BR>
Which I have lost for this eternal night!<BR>
Or, if by dearer ties you may be won,<BR>
By your dead sire, and by your living son,<BR>
Redeem from this reproach my wand'ring ghost;<BR>
Or with your navy seek the Velin coast,<BR>
And in a peaceful grave my corpse compose;<BR>
Or, if a nearer way your mother shows,<BR>
Without whose aid you durst not undertake<BR>
This frightful passage o'er the Stygian lake,<BR>
Lend to this wretch your hand, and waft him o'er<BR>
To the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore."<BR>
Scarce had he said, the prophetess began:<BR>
"What hopes delude thee, miserable man?<BR>
Think'st thou, thus unintomb'd, to cross the floods,<BR>
To view the Furies and infernal gods,<BR>
And visit, without leave, the dark abodes?<BR>
Attend the term of long revolving years;<BR>
Fate, and the dooming gods, are deaf to tears.<BR>
This comfort of thy dire misfortune take:<BR>
The wrath of Heav'n, inflicted for thy sake,<BR>
With vengeance shall pursue th' inhuman coast,<BR>
Till they propitiate thy offended ghost,<BR>
And raise a tomb, with vows and solemn pray'r;<BR>
And Palinurus' name the place shall bear."<BR>
This calm'd his cares; sooth'd with his future fame,<BR>
And pleas'd to hear his propagated name.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now nearer to the Stygian lake they draw:<BR>
Whom, from the shore, the surly boatman saw;<BR>
Observ'd their passage thro' the shady wood,<BR>
And mark'd their near approaches to the flood.<BR>
Then thus he call'd aloud, inflam'd with wrath:<BR>
"Mortal, whate'er, who this forbidden path<BR>
In arms presum'st to tread, I charge thee, stand,<BR>
And tell thy name, and bus'ness in the land.<BR>
Know this, the realm of night- the Stygian shore:<BR>
My boat conveys no living bodies o'er;<BR>
Nor was I pleas'd great Theseus once to bear,<BR>
Who forc'd a passage with his pointed spear,<BR>
Nor strong Alcides- men of mighty fame,<BR>
And from th' immortal gods their lineage came.<BR>
In fetters one the barking porter tied,<BR>
And took him trembling from his sov'reign's side:<BR>
Two sought by force to seize his beauteous bride."<BR>
To whom the Sibyl thus: "Compose thy mind;<BR>
Nor frauds are here contriv'd, nor force design'd.<BR>
Still may the dog the wand'ring troops constrain<BR>
Of airy ghosts, and vex the guilty train,<BR>
And with her grisly lord his lovely queen remain.<BR>
The Trojan chief, whose lineage is from Jove,<BR>
Much fam'd for arms, and more for filial love,<BR>
Is sent to seek his sire in your Elysian grove.<BR>
If neither piety, nor Heav'n's command,<BR>
Can gain his passage to the Stygian strand,<BR>
This fatal present shall prevail at least."<BR>
Then shew'd the shining bough, conceal'd within her vest.<BR>
No more was needful: for the gloomy god<BR>
Stood mute with awe, to see the golden rod;<BR>
Admir'd the destin'd off'ring to his queen-<BR>
A venerable gift, so rarely seen.<BR>
His fury thus appeas'd, he puts to land;<BR>
The ghosts forsake their seats at his command:<BR>
He clears the deck, receives the mighty freight;<BR>
The leaky vessel groans beneath the weight.<BR>
Slowly she sails, and scarcely stems the tides;<BR>
The pressing water pours within her sides.<BR>
His passengers at length are wafted o'er,<BR>
Expos'd, in muddy weeds, upon the miry shore.<BR>

A sop, in honey steep'd, to charm the guard;<BR>
Which, mix'd with pow'rful drugs, she cast before<BR>
His greedy grinning jaws, just op'd to roar.<BR>
With three enormous mouths he gapes; and straight,<BR>
With hunger press'd, devours the pleasing bait.<BR>
Long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave;<BR>

Pass'd on, and took th' irremeable way.<BR>
Before the gates, the cries of babes new born,<BR>

Condemn'd to die, when traitors judg'd their cause.<BR>
Nor want they lots, nor judges to review<BR>
The wrongful sentence, and award a new.<BR>
Minos, the strict inquisitor, appears;<BR>
And lives and crimes, with his assessors, hears.<BR>
Round in his urn the blended balls he rolls,<BR>
Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls.<BR>
The next, in place and punishment, are they<BR>
Who prodigally throw their souls away;<BR>
Fools, who, repining at their wretched state,<BR>
And loathing anxious life, suborn'd their fate.<BR>

Baring her breast, yet bleeding with the wound<BR>
Made by her son. He saw Pasiphae there,<BR>

There Laodamia, with Evadne, moves,<BR>
Unhappy both, but loyal in their loves:<BR>
Caeneus, a woman once, and once a man,<BR>
But ending in the sex she first began.<BR>
Not far from these Phoenician Dido stood,<BR>
Fresh from her wound, her bosom bath'd in blood;<BR>
Whom when the Trojan hero hardly knew,<BR>
Obscure in shades, and with a doubtful view,<BR>
(Doubtful as he who sees, thro' dusky night,<BR>

My flight should urge you to this dire relief.<BR>
Stay, stay your steps, and listen to my vows:<BR>
'T is the last interview that fate allows!"<BR>
In vain he thus attempts her mind to move<BR>
With tears, and pray'rs, and late-repenting love.<BR>
Disdainfully she look'd; then turning round,<BR>
But fix'd her eyes unmov'd upon the ground,<BR>
And what he says and swears, regards no more<BR>
Than the deaf rocks, when the loud billows roar;<BR>
But whirl'd away, to shun his hateful sight,<BR>

Then, of itself, unfolds th' eternal door;<BR>
With dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar.<BR>
You see, before the gate, what stalking ghost<BR>
Commands the guard, what sentries keep the post.<BR>
More formidable Hydra stands within,<BR>
Whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin.<BR>
The gaping gulf low to the center lies,<BR>
And twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies.<BR>
The rivals of the gods, the Titan race,<BR>
Here, sing'd with lightning, roll within th' unfathom'd space.<BR>
Here lie th' Alaean twins, (I saw them both,)<BR>
Enormous bodies, of gigantic growth,<BR>
Who dar'd in fight the Thund'rer to defy,<BR>
Affect his heav'n, and force him from the sky.<BR>
Salmoneus, suff'ring cruel pains, I found,<BR>
For emulating Jove; the rattling sound<BR>
Of mimic thunder, and the glitt'ring blaze<BR>
Of pointed lightnings, and their forky rays.<BR>
Thro' Elis and the Grecian towns he flew;<BR>
Th' audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew:<BR>
He wav'd a torch aloft, and, madly vain,<BR>
Sought godlike worship from a servile train.<BR>
Ambitious fool! with horny hoofs to pass<BR>
O'er hollow arches of resounding brass,<BR>
To rival thunder in its rapid course,<BR>
And imitate inimitable force!<BR>
But he, the King of Heav'n, obscure on high,<BR>
Bar'd his red arm, and, launching from the sky<BR>
His writhen bolt, not shaking empty smoke,<BR>
Down to the deep abyss the flaming felon strook.<BR>
There Tityus was to see, who took his birth<BR>
From heav'n, his nursing from the foodful earth.<BR>
Here his gigantic limbs, with large embrace,<BR>
Infold nine acres of infernal space.<BR>
A rav'nous vulture, in his open'd side,<BR>
Her crooked beak and cruel talons tried;<BR>
Still for the growing liver digg'd his breast;<BR>
The growing liver still supplied the feast;<BR>
Still are his entrails fruitful to their pains:<BR>
Th' immortal hunger lasts, th' immortal food remains.<BR>
Ixion and Perithous I could name,<BR>
And more Thessalian chiefs of mighty fame.<BR>
High o'er their heads a mold'ring rock is plac'd,<BR>
That promises a fall, and shakes at ev'ry blast.<BR>
They lie below, on golden beds display'd;<BR>
And genial feasts with regal pomp are made.<BR>
The Queen of Furies by their sides is set,<BR>
And snatches from their mouths th' untasted meat,<BR>
Which if they touch, her hissing snakes she rears,<BR>
Tossing her torch, and thund'ring in their ears.<BR>
Then they, who brothers' better claim disown,<BR>
Expel their parents, and usurp the throne;<BR>
Defraud their clients, and, to lucre sold,<BR>
Sit brooding on unprofitable gold;<BR>
Who dare not give, and ev'n refuse to lend<BR>
To their poor kindred, or a wanting friend.<BR>
Vast is the throng of these; nor less the train<BR>
Of lustful youths, for foul adult'ry slain:<BR>
Hosts of deserters, who their honor sold,<BR>
And basely broke their faith for bribes of gold.<BR>
All these within the dungeon's depth remain,<BR>
Despairing pardon, and expecting pain.<BR>
Ask not what pains; nor farther seek to know<BR>
Their process, or the forms of law below.<BR>
Some roll a weighty stone; some, laid along,<BR>
And bound with burning wires, on spokes of wheels are hung<BR>
Unhappy Theseus, doom'd for ever there,<BR>
Is fix'd by fate on his eternal chair;<BR>
And wretched Phlegyas warns the world with cries<BR>
(Could warning make the world more just or wise):<BR>
'Learn righteousness, and dread th' avenging deities.'<BR>
To tyrants others have their country sold,<BR>
Imposing foreign lords, for foreign gold;<BR>
Some have old laws repeal'd, new statutes made,<BR>
Not as the people pleas'd, but as they paid;<BR>
With incest some their daughters' bed profan'd:<BR>
All dar'd the worst of ills, and, what they dar'd, attain'd.<BR>
Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues,<BR>
And throats of brass, inspir'd with iron lungs,<BR>
I could not half those horrid crimes repeat,<BR>
Nor half the punishments those crimes have met.<BR>
But let us haste our voyage to pursue:<BR>
The walls of Pluto's palace are in view;<BR>
The gate, and iron arch above it, stands<BR>
On anvils labor'd by the Cyclops' hands.<BR>
Before our farther way the Fates allow,<BR>
Here must we fix on high the golden bough."<BR>

And chose the middle path. Arriv'd at last,<BR>
The prince with living water sprinkled o'er<BR>
His limbs and body; then approach'd the door,<BR>
Possess'd the porch, and on the front above<BR>
He fix'd the fatal bough requir'd by Pluto's love.<BR>
These holy rites perform'd, they took their way<BR>
Where long extended plains of pleasure lay:<BR>
The verdant fields with those of heav'n may vie,<BR>
With ether vested, and a purple sky;<BR>
The blissful seats of happy souls below.<BR>
Stars of their own, and their own suns, they know;<BR>
Their airy limbs in sports they exercise,<BR>
And on the green contend the wrestler's prize.<BR>
Some in heroic verse divinely sing;<BR>
Others in artful measures led the ring.<BR>
The Thracian bard, surrounded by the rest,<BR>
There stands conspicuous in his flowing vest;<BR>
His flying fingers, and harmonious quill,<BR>
Strikes sev'n distinguish'd notes, and sev'n at once they fill.<BR>
Here found they Teucer's old heroic race,<BR>
Born better times and happier years to grace.<BR>
Assaracus and Ilus here enjoy<BR>
Perpetual fame, with him who founded Troy.<BR>
The chief beheld their chariots from afar,<BR>
Their shining arms, and coursers train'd to war:<BR>
Their lances fix'd in earth, their steeds around,<BR>
Free from their harness, graze the flow'ry ground.<BR>
The love of horses which they had, alive,<BR>
And care of chariots, after death survive.<BR>
Some cheerful souls were feasting on the plain;<BR>
Some did the song, and some the choir maintain,<BR>
Beneath a laurel shade, where mighty Po<BR>
Mounts up to woods above, and hides his head below.<BR>
Here patriots live, who, for their country's good,<BR>
In fighting fields, were prodigal of blood:<BR>
Priests of unblemish'd lives here make abode,<BR>
And poets worthy their inspiring god;<BR>
And searching wits, of more mechanic parts,<BR>
Who grac'd their age with new-invented arts:<BR>
Those who to worth their bounty did extend,<BR>
And those who knew that bounty to commend.<BR>
The heads of these with holy fillets bound,<BR>
And all their temples were with garlands crown'd.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
To these the Sibyl thus her speech address'd,<BR>
And first to him surrounded by the rest<BR>
(Tow'ring his height, and ample was his breast):<BR>
"Say, happy souls, divine Musaeus, say,<BR>
Where lives Anchises, and where lies our way<BR>
To find the hero, for whose only sake<BR>
We sought the dark abodes, and cross'd the bitter lake?"<BR>
To this the sacred poet thus replied:<BR>
"In no fix'd place the happy souls reside.<BR>
In groves we live, and lie on mossy beds,<BR>
By crystal streams, that murmur thro' the meads:<BR>
But pass yon easy hill, and thence descend;<BR>
The path conducts you to your journey's end."<BR>
This said, he led them up the mountain's brow,<BR>
And shews them all the shining fields below.<BR>
They wind the hill, and thro' the blissful meadows go.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But old Anchises, in a flow'ry vale,<BR>
Review'd his muster'd race, and took the tale:<BR>
Those happy spirits, which, ordain'd by fate,<BR>
For future beings and new bodies wait-<BR>
With studious thought observ'd th' illustrious throng,<BR>
In nature's order as they pass'd along:<BR>
Their names, their fates, their conduct, and their care,<BR>
In peaceful senates and successful war.<BR>
He, when Aeneas on the plain appears,<BR>
Meets him with open arms, and falling tears.<BR>
"Welcome," he said, "the gods' undoubted race!<BR>
O long expected to my dear embrace!<BR>
Once more 't is giv'n me to behold your face!<BR>
The love and pious duty which you pay<BR>
Have pass'd the perils of so hard a way.<BR>
'T is true, computing times, I now believ'd<BR>
The happy day approach'd; nor are my hopes deceiv'd.<BR>
What length of lands, what oceans have you pass'd;<BR>
What storms sustain'd, and on what shores been cast?<BR>
How have I fear'd your fate! but fear'd it most,<BR>
When love assail'd you, on the Libyan coast."<BR>
To this, the filial duty thus replies:<BR>
"Your sacred ghost before my sleeping eyes<BR>
Appear'd, and often urg'd this painful enterprise.<BR>
After long tossing on the Tyrrhene sea,<BR>
My navy rides at anchor in the bay.<BR>
But reach your hand, O parent shade, nor shun<BR>
The dear embraces of your longing son!"<BR>
He said; and falling tears his face bedew:<BR>
Then thrice around his neck his arms he threw;<BR>
And thrice the flitting shadow slipp'd away,<BR>
Like winds, or empty dreams that fly the day.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now, in a secret vale, the Trojan sees<BR>
A sep'rate grove, thro' which a gentle breeze<BR>
Plays with a passing breath, and whispers thro' the trees;<BR>
And, just before the confines of the wood,<BR>
The gliding Lethe leads her silent flood.<BR>
About the boughs an airy nation flew,<BR>
Thick as the humming bees, that hunt the golden dew;<BR>
In summer's heat on tops of lilies feed,<BR>
And creep within their bells, to suck the balmy seed:<BR>
The winged army roams the fields around;<BR>
The rivers and the rocks remurmur to the sound.<BR>
Aeneas wond'ring stood, then ask'd the cause<BR>
Which to the stream the crowding people draws.<BR>
Then thus the sire: "The souls that throng the flood<BR>
Are those to whom, by fate, are other bodies ow'd:<BR>
In Lethe's lake they long oblivion taste,<BR>
Of future life secure, forgetful of the past.<BR>
Long has my soul desir'd this time and place,<BR>
To set before your sight your glorious race,<BR>
That this presaging joy may fire your mind<BR>
To seek the shores by destiny design'd."-<BR>
"O father, can it be, that souls sublime<BR>
Return to visit our terrestrial clime,<BR>
And that the gen'rous mind, releas'd by death,<BR>
Can covet lazy limbs and mortal breath?"<BR>

Anchises then, in order, thus begun<BR>
To clear those wonders to his godlike son:<BR>
"Know, first, that heav'n, and earth's compacted frame,<BR>
And flowing waters, and the starry flame,<BR>
And both the radiant lights, one common soul<BR>
Inspires and feeds, and animates the whole.<BR>
This active mind, infus'd thro' all the space,<BR>
Unites and mingles with the mighty mass.<BR>
Hence men and beasts the breath of life obtain,<BR>
And birds of air, and monsters of the main.<BR>
Th' ethereal vigor is in all the same,<BR>
And every soul is fill'd with equal flame;<BR>
As much as earthy limbs, and gross allay<BR>
Of mortal members, subject to decay,<BR>
Blunt not the beams of heav'n and edge of day.<BR>
From this coarse mixture of terrestrial parts,<BR>
Desire and fear by turns possess their hearts,<BR>
And grief, and joy; nor can the groveling mind,<BR>
In the dark dungeon of the limbs confin'd,<BR>
Assert the native skies, or own its heav'nly kind:<BR>
Nor death itself can wholly wash their stains;<BR>
But long-contracted filth ev'n in the soul remains.<BR>
The relics of inveterate vice they wear,<BR>
And spots of sin obscene in ev'ry face appear.<BR>
For this are various penances enjoin'd;<BR>
And some are hung to bleach upon the wind,<BR>
Some plung'd in waters, others purg'd in fires,<BR>
Till all the dregs are drain'd, and all the rust expires.<BR>
All have their manes, and those manes bear:<BR>
The few, so cleans'd, to these abodes repair,<BR>
And breathe, in ample fields, the soft Elysian air.<BR>
Then are they happy, when by length of time<BR>
The scurf is worn away of each committed crime;<BR>
No speck is left of their habitual stains,<BR>
But the pure ether of the soul remains.<BR>
But, when a thousand rolling years are past,<BR>
(So long their punishments and penance last,)<BR>
Whole droves of minds are, by the driving god,<BR>
Compell'd to drink the deep Lethaean flood,<BR>
In large forgetful draughts to steep the cares<BR>
Of their past labors, and their irksome years,<BR>
That, unrememb'ring of its former pain,<BR>
The soul may suffer mortal flesh again."<BR>

Thus having said, the father spirit leads<BR>

Nomentum, Bola, with Pometia, found;<BR>
And raise Collatian tow'rs on rocky ground.<BR>
All these shall then be towns of mighty fame,<BR>
Tho' now they lie obscure, and lands without a name.<BR>
See Romulus the great, born to restore<BR>
The crown that once his injur'd grandsire wore.<BR>
This prince a priestess of your blood shall bear,<BR>
And like his sire in arms he shall appear.<BR>
Two rising crests, his royal head adorn;<BR>
Born from a god, himself to godhead born:<BR>
His sire already signs him for the skies,<BR>

Rome, whose ascending tow'rs shall heav'n invade,<BR>
Involving earth and ocean in her shade;<BR>

And the sea trembled with her silver light.<BR>
Now near the shelves of Circe's shores they run,<BR>
(Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,)<BR>
A dang'rous coast: the goddess wastes her days<BR>
In joyous songs; the rocks resound her lays:<BR>
In spinning, or the loom, she spends the night,<BR>

From hence were heard, rebellowing to the main,<BR>

These from their caverns, at the close of night,<BR>

Darkling they mourn their fate, whom Circe's pow'r,<BR>

With words and wicked herbs from humankind<BR>

Which monsters lest the Trojans' pious host<BR>

Which thick with shades and a brown horror stood:<BR>
Betwixt the trees the Tiber took his course,<BR>
With whirlpools dimpled; and with downward force,<BR>
That drove the sand along, he took his way,<BR>
And roll'd his yellow billows to the sea.<BR>
About him, and above, and round the wood,<BR>
The birds that haunt the borders of his flood,<BR>
That bath'd within, or basked upon his side,<BR>

And how concluded by the godlike man:<BR>
For I shall sing of battles, blood, and rage,<BR>
Which princes and their people did engage;<BR>
And haughty souls, that, mov'd with mutual hate,<BR>
In fighting fields pursued and found their fate;<BR>
That rous'd the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms,<BR>
And peaceful Italy involv'd in arms.<BR>
A larger scene of action is display'd;<BR>
And, rising hence, a greater work is weigh'd.<BR>

Latinus, old and mild, had long possess'd<BR>
The Latin scepter, and his people blest:<BR>
His father Faunus; a Laurentian dame<BR>
His mother; fair Marica was her name.<BR>
But Faunus came from Picus: Picus drew<BR>
His birth from Saturn, if records be true.<BR>
Thus King Latinus, in the third degree,<BR>
Had Saturn author of his family.<BR>
But this old peaceful prince, as Heav'n decreed,<BR>
Was blest with no male issue to succeed:<BR>
His sons in blooming youth were snatch'd by fate;<BR>
One only daughter heir'd the royal state.<BR>
Fir'd with her love, and with ambition led,<BR>
The neighb'ring princes court her nuptial bed.<BR>
Among the crowd, but far above the rest,<BR>
Young Turnus to the beauteous maid address'd.<BR>
Turnus, for high descent and graceful mien,<BR>
Was first, and favor'd by the Latian queen;<BR>
With him she strove to join Lavinia's hand,<BR>
But dire portents the purpos'd match withstand.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Deep in the palace, of long growth, there stood<BR>
A laurel's trunk, a venerable wood;<BR>
Where rites divine were paid; whose holy hair<BR>
Was kept and cut with superstitious care.<BR>
This plant Latinus, when his town he wall'd,<BR>
Then found, and from the tree Laurentum call'd;<BR>
And last, in honor of his new abode,<BR>
He vow'd the laurel to the laurel's god.<BR>
It happen'd once (a boding prodigy!)<BR>
A swarm of bees, that cut the liquid sky,<BR>
(Unknown from whence they took their airy flight,)<BR>
Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight;<BR>
There with their clasping feet together clung,<BR>
And a long cluster from the laurel hung.<BR>
An ancient augur prophesied from hence:<BR>
"Behold on Latian shores a foreign prince!<BR>
From the same parts of heav'n his navy stands,<BR>
To the same parts on earth; his army lands;<BR>
The town he conquers, and the tow'r commands."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Yet more, when fair Lavinia fed the fire<BR>
Before the gods, and stood beside her sire,<BR>
(Strange to relate!) the flames, involv'd in smoke<BR>
Of incense, from the sacred altar broke,<BR>
Caught her dishevel'd hair and rich attire;<BR>
Her crown and jewels crackled in the fire:<BR>
From thence the fuming trail began to spread<BR>
And lambent glories danc'd about her head.<BR>
This new portent the seer with wonder views,<BR>
Then pausing, thus his prophecy renews:<BR>
"The nymph, who scatters flaming fires around,<BR>
Shall shine with honor, shall herself be crown'd;<BR>
But, caus'd by her irrevocable fate,<BR>
War shall the country waste, and change the state."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Latinus, frighted with this dire ostent,<BR>
For counsel to his father Faunus went,<BR>
And sought the shades renown'd for prophecy<BR>
Which near Albunea's sulph'rous fountain lie.<BR>
To these the Latian and the Sabine land<BR>
Fly, when distress'd, and thence relief demand.<BR>
The priest on skins of off'rings takes his ease,<BR>
And nightly visions in his slumber sees;<BR>
A swarm of thin aerial shapes appears,<BR>
And, flutt'ring round his temples, deafs his ears:<BR>
These he consults, the future fates to know,<BR>
From pow'rs above, and from the fiends below.<BR>
Here, for the gods' advice, Latinus flies,<BR>
Off'ring a hundred sheep for sacrifice:<BR>
Their woolly fleeces, as the rites requir'd,<BR>
He laid beneath him, and to rest retir'd.<BR>
No sooner were his eyes in slumber bound,<BR>
When, from above, a more than mortal sound<BR>
Invades his ears; and thus the vision spoke:<BR>
"Seek not, my seed, in Latian bands to yoke<BR>
Our fair Lavinia, nor the gods provoke.<BR>
A foreign son upon thy shore descends,<BR>
Whose martial fame from pole to pole extends.<BR>
His race, in arms and arts of peace renown'd,<BR>
Not Latium shall contain, nor Europe bound:<BR>
'T is theirs whate'er the sun surveys around."<BR>
These answers, in the silent night receiv'd,<BR>
The king himself divulg'd, the land believ'd:<BR>
The fame thro' all the neighb'ring nations flew,<BR>
When now the Trojan navy was in view.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Beneath a shady tree, the hero spread<BR>
His table on the turf, with cakes of bread;<BR>
And, with his chiefs, on forest fruits he fed.<BR>
They sate; and, (not without the god's command,)<BR>
Their homely fare dispatch'd, the hungry band<BR>
Invade their trenchers next, and soon devour,<BR>
To mend the scanty meal, their cakes of flour.<BR>
Ascanius this observ'd, and smiling said:<BR>
"See, we devour the plates on which we fed."<BR>
The speech had omen, that the Trojan race<BR>
Should find repose, and this the time and place.<BR>
Aeneas took the word, and thus replies,<BR>
Confessing fate with wonder in his eyes:<BR>
"All hail, O earth! all hail, my household gods!<BR>
Behold the destin'd place of your abodes!<BR>
For thus Anchises prophesied of old,<BR>
And this our fatal place of rest foretold:<BR>
'When, on a foreign shore, instead of meat,<BR>
By famine forc'd, your trenchers you shall eat,<BR>
Then ease your weary Trojans will attend,<BR>
And the long labors of your voyage end.<BR>
Remember on that happy coast to build,<BR>
And with a trench inclose the fruitful field.'<BR>
This was that famine, this the fatal place<BR>
Which ends the wand'ring of our exil'd race.<BR>
Then, on to-morrow's dawn, your care employ,<BR>
To search the land, and where the cities lie,<BR>
And what the men; but give this day to joy.<BR>
Now pour to Jove; and, after Jove is blest,<BR>
Call great Anchises to the genial feast:<BR>
Crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught;<BR>
Enjoy the present hour; adjourn the future thought."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thus having said, the hero bound his brows<BR>
With leafy branches, then perform'd his vows;<BR>
Adoring first the genius of the place,<BR>
Then Earth, the mother of the heav'nly race,<BR>
The nymphs, and native godheads yet unknown,<BR>
And Night, and all the stars that gild her sable throne,<BR>
And ancient Cybel, and Idaean Jove,<BR>
And last his sire below, and mother queen above.<BR>
Then heav'n's high monarch thunder'd thrice aloud,<BR>
And thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud.<BR>
Soon thro' the joyful camp a rumor flew,<BR>
The time was come their city to renew.<BR>
Then ev'ry brow with cheerful green is crown'd,<BR>
The feasts are doubled, and the bowls go round.<BR>

When next the rosy morn disclos'd the day,<BR>
The scouts to sev'ral parts divide their way,<BR>
To learn the natives' names, their towns explore,<BR>
The coasts and trendings of the crooked shore:<BR>
Here Tiber flows, and here Numicus stands;<BR>
Here warlike Latins hold the happy lands.<BR>
The pious chief, who sought by peaceful ways<BR>
To found his empire, and his town to raise,<BR>
A hundred youths from all his train selects,<BR>

And all their heads with wreaths of olive hides.<BR>
They go commission'd to require a peace,<BR>
And carry presents to procure access.<BR>
Thus while they speed their pace, the prince designs<BR>
His new-elected seat, and draws the lines.<BR>
The Trojans round the place a rampire cast,<BR>

Meantime the train, proceeding on their way,<BR>

Some drive the cars, and some the coursers rein;<BR>
Some bend the stubborn bow for victory,<BR>
And some with darts their active sinews try.<BR>
A posting messenger, dispatch'd from hence,<BR>
Of this fair troop advis'd their aged prince,<BR>

The palace built by Picus, vast and proud,<BR>
Supported by a hundred pillars stood,<BR>
And round incompass'd with a rising wood.<BR>
The pile o'erlook'd the town, and drew the sight;<BR>
Surpris'd at once with reverence and delight.<BR>
There kings receiv'd the marks of sov'reign pow'r;<BR>
In state the monarchs march'd; the lictors bore<BR>
Their awful axes and the rods before.<BR>
Here the tribunal stood, the house of pray'r,<BR>

All at large tables, in long order set,<BR>
A ram their off'ring, and a ram their meat.<BR>
Above the portal, carv'd in cedar wood,<BR>
Plac'd in their ranks, their godlike grandsires stood;<BR>
Old Saturn, with his crooked scythe, on high;<BR>
And Italus, that led the colony;<BR>
And ancient Janus, with his double face,<BR>
And bunch of keys, the porter of the place.<BR>
There good Sabinus, planter of the vines,<BR>
On a short pruning hook his head reclines,<BR>
And studiously surveys his gen'rous wines;<BR>
Then warlike kings, who for their country fought,<BR>
And honorable wounds from battle brought.<BR>
Around the posts hung helmets, darts, and spears,<BR>
And captive chariots, axes, shields, and bars,<BR>
And broken beaks of ships, the trophies of their wars.<BR>
Above the rest, as chief of all the band,<BR>
Was Picus plac'd, a buckler in his hand;<BR>
His other wav'd a long divining wand.<BR>
Girt in his Gabin gown the hero sate,<BR>
Yet could not with his art avoid his fate:<BR>
For Circe long had lov'd the youth in vain,<BR>
Till love, refus'd, converted to disdain:<BR>
Then, mixing pow'rful herbs, with magic art,<BR>
She chang'd his form, who could not change his heart;<BR>
Constrain'd him in a bird, and made him fly,<BR>

In this high temple, on a chair of state,<BR>
The seat of audience, old Latinus sate;<BR>
Then gave admission to the Trojan train;<BR>
And thus with pleasing accents he began:<BR>
"Tell me, ye Trojans, for that name you own,<BR>
Nor is your course upon our coasts unknown-<BR>
Say what you seek, and whither were you bound:<BR>
Were you by stress of weather cast aground?<BR>
(Such dangers as on seas are often seen,<BR>
And oft befall to miserable men,)<BR>
Or come, your shipping in our ports to lay,<BR>
Spent and disabled in so long a way?<BR>
Say what you want: the Latians you shall find<BR>
Not forc'd to goodness, but by will inclin'd;<BR>
For, since the time of Saturn's holy reign,<BR>
His hospitable customs we retain.<BR>
I call to mind (but time the tale has worn)<BR>
Th' Arunci told, that Dardanus, tho' born<BR>
On Latian plains, yet sought the Phrygian shore,<BR>
And Samothracia, Samos call'd before.<BR>
From Tuscan Coritum he claim'd his birth;<BR>
But after, when exempt from mortal earth,<BR>
From thence ascended to his kindred skies,<BR>
A god, and, as a god, augments their sacrifice,"<BR>

The port, so long desir'd, at length we found;<BR>
From our sweet homes and ancient realms expell'd;<BR>
Great as the greatest that the sun beheld.<BR>
The god began our line, who rules above;<BR>
And, as our race, our king descends from Jove:<BR>
And hither are we come, by his command,<BR>
To crave admission in your happy land.<BR>
How dire a tempest, from Mycenae pour'd,<BR>
Our plains, our temples, and our town devour'd;<BR>
What was the waste of war, what fierce alarms<BR>
Shook Asia's crown with European arms;<BR>
Ev'n such have heard, if any such there be,<BR>
Whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea;<BR>
And such as, born beneath the burning sky<BR>
And sultry sun, betwixt the tropics lie.<BR>
From that dire deluge, thro' the wat'ry waste,<BR>
Such length of years, such various perils past,<BR>
At last escap'd, to Latium we repair,<BR>
To beg what you without your want may spare:<BR>
The common water, and the common air;<BR>
Sheds which ourselves will build, and mean abodes,<BR>
Fit to receive and serve our banish'd gods.<BR>
Nor our admission shall your realm disgrace,<BR>
Nor length of time our gratitude efface.<BR>
Besides, what endless honor you shall gain,<BR>
To save and shelter Troy's unhappy train!<BR>
Now, by my sov'reign, and his fate, I swear,<BR>
Renown'd for faith in peace, for force in war;<BR>
Oft our alliance other lands desir'd,<BR>
And, what we seek of you, of us requir'd.<BR>
Despite not then, that in our hands we bear<BR>
These holy boughs, sue with words of pray'r.<BR>
Fate and the gods, by their supreme command,<BR>
Have doom'd our ships to seek the Latian land.<BR>
To these abodes our fleet Apollo sends;<BR>
Here Dardanus was born, and hither tends;<BR>
Where Tuscan Tiber rolls with rapid force,<BR>
And where Numicus opes his holy source.<BR>
Besides, our prince presents, with his request,<BR>
Some small remains of what his sire possess'd.<BR>
This golden charger, snatch'd from burning Troy,<BR>
Anchises did in sacrifice employ;<BR>
This royal robe and this tiara wore<BR>
Old Priam, and this golden scepter bore<BR>

Thus while he spoke, Latinus roll'd around<BR>
His eyes, and fix'd a while upon the ground.<BR>
Intent he seem'd, and anxious in his breast;<BR>
Not by the scepter mov'd, or kingly vest,<BR>
But pond'ring future things of wondrous weight;<BR>
Succession, empire, and his daughter's fate.<BR>
On these he mus'd within his thoughtful mind,<BR>
And then revolv'd what Faunus had divin'd.<BR>
This was the foreign prince, by fate decreed<BR>
To share his scepter, and Lavinia's bed;<BR>
This was the race that sure portents foreshew<BR>
To sway the world, and land and sea subdue.<BR>
At length he rais'd his cheerful head, and spoke:<BR>

Have what you ask; your presents I receive;<BR>
Land, where and when you please, with ample leave;<BR>
Partake and use my kingdom as your own;<BR>
All shall be yours, while I command the crown:<BR>
And, if my wish'd alliance please your king,<BR>
Tell him he should not send the peace, but bring.<BR>
Then let him not a friend's embraces fear;<BR>
The peace is made when I behold him here.<BR>
Besides this answer, tell my royal guest,<BR>
I add to his commands my own request:<BR>
One only daughter heirs my crown and state,<BR>
Whom not our oracles, nor Heav'n, nor fate,<BR>
Nor frequent prodigies, permit to join<BR>
With any native of th' Ausonian line.<BR>
A foreign son-in-law shall come from far<BR>
(Such is our doom), a chief renown'd in war,<BR>
Whose race shall bear aloft the Latian name,<BR>
And thro' the conquer'd world diffuse our fame.<BR>
Himself to be the man the fates require,<BR>

On Tiber's shores they land, secure of fate,<BR>
Triumphant o'er the storms and Juno's hate.<BR>

Shook high above her head a flaming pine;<BR>
Then roll'd her haggard eyes around the throng,<BR>

Once a fair city, now consum'd with years.<BR>

Betwixt the confines of the night and day,<BR>
Secure in sleep. The Fury laid aside<BR>

Sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws;<BR>
Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound,<BR>
Her temples with an olive wreath are crown'd.<BR>
Old Chalybe, who kept the sacred fane<BR>
Of Juno, now she seem'd, and thus began,<BR>
Appearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man:<BR>
"Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain<BR>
In fighting fields, and conquer towns in vain?<BR>
Win, for a Trojan head to wear the prize,<BR>
Usurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories?<BR>
The bride and scepter which thy blood has bought,<BR>
The king transfers; and foreign heirs are sought.<BR>
Go now, deluded man, and seek again<BR>
New toils, new dangers, on the dusty plain.<BR>
Repel the Tuscan foes; their city seize;<BR>
Protect the Latians in luxurious ease.<BR>
This dream all-pow'rful Juno sends; I bear<BR>
Her mighty mandates, and her words you hear.<BR>
Haste; arm your Ardeans; issue to the plain;<BR>
With fate to friend, assault the Trojan train:<BR>
Their thoughtless chiefs, their painted ships, that lie<BR>
In Tiber's mouth, with fire and sword destroy.<BR>
The Latian king, unless he shall submit,<BR>
Own his old promise, and his new forget-<BR>
Let him, in arms, the pow'r of Turnus prove,<BR>
And learn to fear whom he disdains to love.<BR>
For such is Heav'n's command." The youthful prince<BR>
With scorn replied, and made this bold defense:<BR>
"You tell me, mother, what I knew before:<BR>
The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore.<BR>
I neither fear nor will provoke the war;<BR>
My fate is Juno's most peculiar care.<BR>
But time has made you dote, and vainly tell<BR>
Of arms imagin'd in your lonely cell.<BR>
Go; be the temple and the gods your care;<BR>
Permit to men the thought of peace and war."<BR>

Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place,<BR>
And open all the furies of her face:<BR>
Then, darting fire from her malignant eyes,<BR>
She cast him backward as he strove to rise,<BR>
And, ling'ring, sought to frame some new replies.<BR>
High on her head she rears two twisted snakes,<BR>
Her chains she rattles, and her whip she shakes;<BR>
And, churning bloody foam, thus loudly speaks:<BR>
"Behold whom time has made to dote, and tell<BR>

War, death, destruction, in my hand I bear."<BR>

A bloody Hymen shall th' alliance join<BR>

Devour her o'er and o'er with vast delight;<BR>
Her purple habit sits with such a grace<BR>
On her smooth shoulders, and so suits her face;<BR>
Her head with ringlets of her hair is crown'd,<BR>
And in a golden caul the curls are bound.<BR>
She shakes her myrtle jav'lin; and, behind,<BR>
Her Lycian quiver dances in the wind.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
When Turnus had assembled all his pow'rs,<BR>
His standard planted on Laurentum's tow'rs;<BR>
When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar,<BR>
Had giv'n the signal of approaching war,<BR>
Had rous'd the neighing steeds to scour the fields,<BR>
While the fierce riders clatter'd on their shields;<BR>
Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare<BR>
To join th' allies, and headlong rush to war.<BR>
Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd,<BR>
With bold Mezentius, who blasphem'd aloud.<BR>
These thro' the country took their wasteful course,<BR>
The fields to forage, and to gather force.<BR>
Then Venulus to Diomede they send,<BR>
To beg his aid Ausonia to defend,<BR>
Declare the common danger, and inform<BR>
The Grecian leader of the growing storm:<BR>
Aeneas, landed on the Latian coast,<BR>
With banish'd gods, and with a baffled host,<BR>
Yet now aspir'd to conquest of the state,<BR>
And claim'd a title from the gods and fate;<BR>
What num'rous nations in his quarrel came,<BR>
And how they spread his formidable name.<BR>
What he design'd, what mischief might arise,<BR>
If fortune favor'd his first enterprise,<BR>
Was left for him to weigh, whose equal fears,<BR>
And common interest, was involv'd in theirs.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
While Turnus and th' allies thus urge the war,<BR>
The Trojan, floating in a flood of care,<BR>
Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare.<BR>
This way and that he turns his anxious mind;<BR>
Thinks, and rejects the counsels he design'd;<BR>
Explores himself in vain, in ev'ry part,<BR>
And gives no rest to his distracted heart.<BR>
So, when the sun by day, or moon by night,<BR>
Strike on the polish'd brass their trembling light,<BR>
The glitt'ring species here and there divide,<BR>
And cast their dubious beams from side to side;<BR>
Now on the walls, now on the pavement play,<BR>
And to the ceiling flash the glaring day.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
'T was night; and weary nature lull'd asleep<BR>
The birds of air, and fishes of the deep,<BR>
And beasts, and mortal men. The Trojan chief<BR>
Was laid on Tiber's banks, oppress'd with grief,<BR>
And found in silent slumber late relief.<BR>
Then, thro' the shadows of the poplar wood,<BR>
Arose the father of the Roman flood;<BR>
An azure robe was o'er his body spread,<BR>
A wreath of shady reeds adorn'd his head:<BR>
Thus, manifest to sight, the god appear'd,<BR>
And with these pleasing words his sorrow cheer'd:<BR>
"Undoubted offspring of ethereal race,<BR>
O long expected in this promis'd place!<BR>
Who thro' the foes hast borne thy banish'd gods,<BR>
Restor'd them to their hearths, and old abodes;<BR>
This is thy happy home, the clime where fate<BR>
Ordains thee to restore the Trojan state.<BR>
Fear not! The war shall end in lasting peace,<BR>
And all the rage of haughty Juno cease.<BR>
And that this nightly vision may not seem<BR>
Th' effect of fancy, or an idle dream,<BR>
A sow beneath an oak shall lie along,<BR>
All white herself, and white her thirty young.<BR>
When thirty rolling years have run their race,<BR>
Thy son Ascanius, on this empty space,<BR>
Shall build a royal town, of lasting fame,<BR>
Which from this omen shall receive the name.<BR>
Time shall approve the truth. For what remains,<BR>
And how with sure success to crown thy pains,<BR>
With patience next attend. A banish'd band,<BR>
Driv'n with Evander from th' Arcadian land,<BR>
Have planted here, and plac'd on high their walls;<BR>
Their town the founder Pallanteum calls,<BR>
Deriv'd from Pallas, his great-grandsire's name:<BR>
But the fierce Latians old possession claim,<BR>
With war infesting the new colony.<BR>
These make thy friends, and on their aid rely.<BR>
To thy free passage I submit my streams.<BR>
Wake, son of Venus, from thy pleasing dreams;<BR>
And, when the setting stars are lost in day,<BR>
To Juno's pow'r thy just devotion pay;<BR>
With sacrifice the wrathful queen appease:<BR>
Her pride at length shall fall, her fury cease.<BR>
When thou return'st victorious from the war,<BR>
Perform thy vows to me with grateful care.<BR>
The god am I, whose yellow water flows<BR>
Around these fields, and fattens as it goes:<BR>
Tiber my name; among the rolling floods<BR>
Renown'd on earth, esteem'd among the gods.<BR>
This is my certain seat. In times to come,<BR>
My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He said, and plung'd below. While yet he spoke,<BR>
His dream Aeneas and his sleep forsook.<BR>
He rose, and looking up, beheld the skies<BR>
With purple blushing, and the day arise.<BR>
Then water in his hollow palm he took<BR>
From Tiber's flood, and thus the pow'rs bespoke:<BR>
"Laurentian nymphs, by whom the streams are fed,<BR>
And Father Tiber, in thy sacred bed<BR>
Receive Aeneas, and from danger keep.<BR>
Whatever fount, whatever holy deep,<BR>
Conceals thy wat'ry stores; where'er they rise,<BR>
And, bubbling from below, salute the skies;<BR>
Thou, king of horned floods, whose plenteous urn<BR>
Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn,<BR>
For this thy kind compassion of our woes,<BR>
Shalt share my morning song and ev'ning vows.<BR>
But, O be present to thy people's aid,<BR>
And firm the gracious promise thou hast made!"<BR>
Thus having said, two galleys from his stores,<BR>
With care he chooses, mans, and fits with oars.<BR>
Now on the shore the fatal swine is found.<BR>
Wondrous to tell!- She lay along the ground:<BR>
Her well-fed offspring at her udders hung;<BR>
She white herself, and white her thirty young.<BR>
Aeneas takes the mother and her brood,<BR>
And all on Juno's altar are bestow'd.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The foll'wing night, and the succeeding day,<BR>
Propitious Tiber smooth'd his wat'ry way:<BR>
He roll'd his river back, and pois'd he stood,<BR>
A gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood.<BR>
The Trojans mount their ships; they put from shore,<BR>
Borne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar.<BR>
Shouts from the land give omen to their course,<BR>
And the pitch'd vessels glide with easy force.<BR>
The woods and waters wonder at the gleam<BR>
Of shields, and painted ships that stem the stream.<BR>
One summer's night and one whole day they pass<BR>
Betwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass.<BR>
The fiery sun had finish'd half his race,<BR>
Look'd back, and doubted in the middle space,<BR>
When they from far beheld the rising tow'rs,<BR>
The tops of sheds, and shepherds' lowly bow'rs,<BR>
Thin as they stood, which, then of homely clay,<BR>
Now rise in marble, from the Roman sway.<BR>
These cots (Evander's kingdom, mean and poor)<BR>
The Trojan saw, and turn'd his ships to shore.<BR>
'T was on a solemn day: th' Arcadian states,<BR>
The king and prince, without the city gates,<BR>
Then paid their off'rings in a sacred grove<BR>
To Hercules, the warrior son of Jove.<BR>
Thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies,<BR>
And fat of entrails on his altar fries.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But, when they saw the ships that stemm'd the flood,<BR>
And glitter'd thro' the covert of the wood,<BR>
They rose with fear, and left th' unfinish'd feast,<BR>
Till dauntless Pallas reassur'd the rest<BR>
To pay the rites. Himself without delay<BR>
A jav'lin seiz'd, and singly took his way;<BR>
Then gain'd a rising ground, and call'd from far:<BR>
"Resolve me, strangers, whence, and what you are;<BR>
Your bus'ness here; and bring you peace or war?"<BR>
High on the stern Aeneas his stand,<BR>
And held a branch of olive in his hand,<BR>
While thus he spoke: "The Phrygians' arms you see,<BR>
Expell'd from Troy, provok'd in Italy<BR>
By Latian foes, with war unjustly made;<BR>
At first affianc'd, and at last betray'd.<BR>
This message bear: 'The Trojans and their chief<BR>
Bring holy peace, and beg the king's relief.'<BR>
Struck with so great a name, and all on fire,<BR>
The youth replies: "Whatever you require,<BR>
Your fame exacts. Upon our shores descend.<BR>
A welcome guest, and, what you wish, a friend."<BR>
He said, and, downward hasting to the strand,<BR>
Embrac'd the stranger prince, and join'd his hand.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Conducted to the grove, Aeneas broke<BR>
The silence first, and thus the king bespoke:<BR>
"Best of the Greeks, to whom, by fate's command,<BR>
I bear these peaceful branches in my hand,<BR>
Undaunted I approach you, tho' I know<BR>
Your birth is Grecian, and your land my foe;<BR>
From Atreus tho' your ancient lineage came,<BR>
And both the brother kings your kindred claim;<BR>
Yet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown,<BR>
Your virtue, thro' the neighb'ring nations blown,<BR>
Our fathers' mingled blood, Apollo's voice,<BR>
Have led me hither, less by need than choice.<BR>
Our founder Dardanus, as fame has sung,<BR>
And Greeks acknowledge, from Electra sprung:<BR>
Electra from the loins of Atlas came;<BR>
Atlas, whose head sustains the starry frame.<BR>
Your sire is Mercury, whom long before<BR>
On cold Cyllene's top fair Maia bore.<BR>
Maia the fair, on fame if we rely,<BR>
Was Atlas' daughter, who sustains the sky.<BR>
Thus from one common source our streams divide;<BR>
Ours is the Trojan, yours th' Arcadian side.<BR>
Rais'd by these hopes, I sent no news before,<BR>
Nor ask'd your leave, nor did your faith implore;<BR>
But come, without a pledge, my own ambassador.<BR>
The same Rutulians, who with arms pursue<BR>
The Trojan race, are equal foes to you.<BR>
Our host expell'd, what farther force can stay<BR>
The victor troops from universal sway?<BR>
Then will they stretch their pow'r athwart the land,<BR>
And either sea from side to side command.<BR>
Receive our offer'd faith, and give us thine;<BR>
Ours is a gen'rous and experienc'd line:<BR>
We want not hearts nor bodies for the war;<BR>
In council cautious, and in fields we dare."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He said; and while spoke, with piercing eyes<BR>
Evander view'd the man with vast surprise,<BR>
Pleas'd with his action, ravish'd with his face:<BR>
Then answer'd briefly, with a royal grace:<BR>
"O valiant leader of the Trojan line,<BR>
In whom the features of thy father shine,<BR>
How I recall Anchises! how I see<BR>
His motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee!<BR>
Long tho' it be, 't is fresh within my mind,<BR>
When Priam to his sister's court design'd<BR>
A welcome visit, with a friendly stay,<BR>
And thro' th' Arcadian kingdom took his way.<BR>
Then, past a boy, the callow down began<BR>
To shade my chin, and call me first a man.<BR>
I saw the shining train with vast delight,<BR>
And Priam's goodly person pleas'd my sight:<BR>
But great Anchises, far above the rest,<BR>
With awful wonder fir'd my youthful breast.<BR>
I long'd to join in friendship's holy bands<BR>
Our mutual hearts, and plight our mutual hands.<BR>
I first accosted him: I sued, I sought,<BR>
And, with a loving force, to Pheneus brought.<BR>
He gave me, when at length constrain'd to go,<BR>
A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow,<BR>
A vest embroider'd, glorious to behold,<BR>
And two rich bridles, with their bits of gold,<BR>
Which my son's coursers in obedience hold.<BR>
The league you ask, I offer, as your right;<BR>
And, when to-morrow's sun reveals the light,<BR>
With swift supplies you shall be sent away.<BR>
Now celebrate with us this solemn day,<BR>
Whose holy rites admit no long delay.<BR>
Honor our annual feast; and take your seat,<BR>
With friendly welcome, at a homely treat."<BR>
Thus having said, the bowls (remov'd for fear)<BR>
The youths replac'd, and soon restor'd the cheer.<BR>
On sods of turf he set the soldiers round:<BR>
A maple throne, rais'd higher from the ground,<BR>
Receiv'd the Trojan chief; and, o'er the bed,<BR>
A lion's shaggy hide for ornament they spread.<BR>
The loaves were serv'd in canisters; the wine<BR>
In bowls; the priest renew'd the rites divine:<BR>
Broil'd entrails are their food, and beef's continued chine.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But when the rage of hunger was repress'd,<BR>
Thus spoke Evander to his royal guest:<BR>
"These rites, these altars, and this feast, O king,<BR>
From no vain fears or superstition spring,<BR>
Or blind devotion, or from blinder chance,<BR>
Or heady zeal, or brutal ignorance;<BR>
But, sav'd from danger, with a grateful sense,<BR>
The labors of a god we recompense.<BR>
See, from afar, yon rock that mates the sky,<BR>
About whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie;<BR>
Such indigested ruin; bleak and bare,<BR>
How desart now it stands, expos'd in air!<BR>
'T was once a robber's den, inclos'd around<BR>
With living stone, and deep beneath the ground.<BR>
The monster Cacus, more than half a beast,<BR>
This hold, impervious to the sun, possess'd.<BR>
The pavement ever foul with human gore;<BR>
Heads, and their mangled members, hung the door.<BR>
Vulcan this plague begot; and, like his sire,<BR>
Black clouds he belch'd, and flakes of livid fire.<BR>
Time, long expected, eas'd us of our load,<BR>
And brought the needful presence of a god.<BR>
Th' avenging force of Hercules, from Spain,<BR>
Arriv'd in triumph, from Geryon slain:<BR>
Thrice liv'd the giant, and thrice liv'd in vain.<BR>
His prize, the lowing herds, Alcides drove<BR>
Near Tiber's bank, to graze the shady grove.<BR>
Allur'd with hope of plunder, and intent<BR>
By force to rob, by fraud to circumvent,<BR>
The brutal Cacus, as by chance they stray'd,<BR>
Four oxen thence, and four fair kine convey'd;<BR>
And, lest the printed footsteps might be seen,<BR>
He dragg'd 'em backwards to his rocky den.<BR>
The tracks averse a lying notice gave,<BR>
And led the searcher backward from the cave.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place,<BR>
To find fresh pasture and untrodden grass.<BR>
The beasts, who miss'd their mates, fill'd all around<BR>
With bellowings, and the rocks restor'd the sound.<BR>
One heifer, who had heard her love complain,<BR>
Roar'd from the cave, and made the project vain.<BR>
Alcides found the fraud; with rage he shook,<BR>
And toss'd about his head his knotted oak.<BR>
Swift as the winds, or Scythian arrows' flight,<BR>
He clomb, with eager haste, th' aerial height.<BR>
Then first we saw the monster mend his pace;<BR>
Fear his eyes, and paleness in his face,<BR>
Confess'd the god's approach. Trembling he springs,<BR>
As terror had increas'd his feet with wings;<BR>
Nor stay'd for stairs; but down the depth he threw<BR>
His body, on his back the door he drew<BR>
(The door, a rib of living rock; with pains<BR>
His father hew'd it out, and bound with iron chains):<BR>
He broke the heavy links, the mountain clos'd,<BR>
And bars and levers to his foe oppos'd.<BR>
The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast;<BR>
The fierce avenger came with bounding haste;<BR>
Survey'd the mouth of the forbidden hold,<BR>
And here and there his raging eyes he roll'd.<BR>
He gnash'd his teeth; and thrice he compass'd round<BR>
With winged speed the circuit of the ground.<BR>
Thrice at the cavern's mouth he pull'd in vain,<BR>
And, panting, thrice desisted from his pain.<BR>
A pointed flinty rock, all bare and black,<BR>
Grew gibbous from behind the mountain's back;<BR>
Owls, ravens, all ill omens of the night,<BR>
Here built their nests, and hither wing'd their flight.<BR>
The leaning head hung threat'ning o'er the flood,<BR>
And nodded to the left. The hero stood<BR>
Adverse, with planted feet, and, from the right,<BR>
Tugg'd at the solid stone with all his might.<BR>
Thus heav'd, the fix'd foundations of the rock<BR>
Gave way; heav'n echo'd at the rattling shock.<BR>
Tumbling, it chok'd the flood: on either side<BR>
The banks leap backward, and the streams divide;<BR>
The sky shrunk upward with unusual dread,<BR>
And trembling Tiber div'd beneath his bed.<BR>
The court of Cacus stands reveal'd to sight;<BR>
The cavern glares with new-admitted light.<BR>
So the pent vapors, with a rumbling sound,<BR>
Heave from below, and rend the hollow ground;<BR>
A sounding flaw succeeds; and, from on high,<BR>
The gods with hate beheld the nether sky:<BR>
The ghosts repine at violated night,<BR>
And curse th' invading sun, and sicken at the sight.<BR>
The graceless monster, caught in open day,<BR>
Inclos'd, and in despair to fly away,<BR>
Howls horrible from underneath, and fills<BR>
His hollow palace with unmanly yells.<BR>
The hero stands above, and from afar<BR>
Plies him with darts, and stones, and distant war.<BR>
He, from his nostrils huge mouth, expires<BR>
Black clouds of smoke, amidst his father's fires,<BR>
Gath'ring, with each repeated blast, the night,<BR>
To make uncertain aim, and erring sight.<BR>
The wrathful god then plunges from above,<BR>
And, where in thickest waves the sparkles drove,<BR>
There lights; and wades thro' fumes, and gropes his way,<BR>
Half sing'd, half stifled, till he grasps his prey.<BR>
The monster, spewing fruitless flames, he found;<BR>
He squeez'd his throat; he writh'd his neck around,<BR>
And in a knot his crippled members bound;<BR>
Then from their sockets tore his burning eyes:<BR>
Roll'd on a heap, the breathless robber lies.<BR>
The doors, unbarr'd, receive the rushing day,<BR>
And thoro' lights disclose the ravish'd prey.<BR>
The bulls, redeem'd, breathe open air again.<BR>
Next, by the feet, they drag him from his den.<BR>
The wond'ring neighborhood, with glad surprise,<BR>
Behold his shagged breast, his giant size,<BR>
His mouth that flames no more, and his extinguish'd eyes.<BR>
From that auspicious day, with rites divine,<BR>
We worship at the hero's holy shrine.<BR>
Potitius first ordain'd these annual vows:<BR>
As priests, were added the Pinarian house,<BR>
Who rais'd this altar in the sacred shade,<BR>
Where honors, ever due, for ever shall be paid.<BR>
For these deserts, and this high virtue shown,<BR>
Ye warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown:<BR>
Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood,<BR>
And with deep draughts invoke our common god."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
This said, a double wreath Evander twin'd,<BR>
And poplars black and white his temples bind.<BR>
Then brims his ample bowl. With like design<BR>
The rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine.<BR>
Meantime the sun descended from the skies,<BR>
And the bright evening star began to rise.<BR>
And now the priests, Potitius at their head,<BR>
In skins of beasts involv'd, the long procession led;<BR>
Held high the flaming tapers in their hands,<BR>
As custom had prescrib'd their holy bands;<BR>
Then with a second course the tables load,<BR>
And with full chargers offer to the god.<BR>
The Salii sing, and cense his altars round<BR>
With Saban smoke, their heads with poplar bound-<BR>
One choir of old, another of the young,<BR>
To dance, and bear the burthen of the song.<BR>
The lay records the labors, and the praise,<BR>
And all th' immortal acts of Hercules:<BR>
First, how the mighty babe, when swath'd in bands,<BR>
The serpents strangled with his infant hands;<BR>
Then, as in years and matchless force he grew,<BR>
Th' Oechalian walls, and Trojan, overthrew.<BR>
Besides, a thousand hazards they relate,<BR>
Procur'd by Juno's and Eurystheus' hate:<BR>
"Thy hands, unconquer'd hero, could subdue<BR>
The cloud-born Centaurs, and the monster crew:<BR>
Nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood,<BR>
Nor he, the roaring terror of the wood.<BR>
The triple porter of the Stygian seat,<BR>
With lolling tongue, lay fawning at thy feet,<BR>
And, seiz'd with fear, forgot his mangled meat.<BR>
Th' infernal waters trembled at thy sight;<BR>
Thee, god, no face of danger could affright;<BR>
Not huge Typhoeus, nor th' unnumber'd snake,<BR>
Increas'd with hissing heads, in Lerna's lake.<BR>
Hail, Jove's undoubted son! an added grace<BR>
To heav'n and the great author of thy race!<BR>
Receive the grateful off'rings which we pay,<BR>
And smile propitious on thy solemn day!"<BR>
In numbers thus they sung; above the rest,<BR>
The den and death of Cacus crown the feast.<BR>
The woods to hollow vales convey the sound,<BR>
The vales to hills, and hills the notes rebound.<BR>
The rites perform'd, the cheerful train retire.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire,<BR>
The Trojan pass'd, the city to survey,<BR>
And pleasing talk beguil'd the tedious way.<BR>
The stranger cast around his curious eyes,<BR>
New objects viewing still, with new surprise;<BR>
With greedy joy enquires of various things,<BR>
And acts and monuments of ancient kings.<BR>
Then thus the founder of the Roman tow'rs:<BR>
"These woods were first the seat of sylvan pow'rs,<BR>
Of Nymphs and Fauns, and salvage men, who took<BR>
Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak.<BR>
Nor laws they knew, nor manners, nor the care<BR>
Of lab'ring oxen, or the shining share,<BR>
Nor arts of gain, nor what they gain'd to spare.<BR>
Their exercise the chase; the running flood<BR>
Supplied their thirst, the trees supplied their food.<BR>
Then Saturn came, who fled the pow'r of Jove,<BR>
Robb'd of his realms, and banish'd from above.<BR>
The men, dispers'd on hills, to towns he brought,<BR>
And laws ordain'd, and civil customs taught,<BR>
And Latium call'd the land where safe he lay<BR>
From his unduteous son, and his usurping sway.<BR>
With his mild empire, peace and plenty came;<BR>
And hence the golden times deriv'd their name.<BR>
A more degenerate and discolor'd age<BR>
Succeeded this, with avarice and rage.<BR>
Th' Ausonians then, and bold Sicanians came;<BR>
And Saturn's empire often chang'd the name.<BR>
Then kings, gigantic Tybris, and the rest,<BR>
With arbitrary sway the land oppress'd:<BR>
For Tiber's flood was Albula before,<BR>
Till, from the tyrant's fate, his name it bore.<BR>
I last arriv'd, driv'n from my native home<BR>
By fortune's pow'r, and fate's resistless doom.<BR>
Long toss'd on seas, I sought this happy land,<BR>
Warn'd by my mother nymph, and call'd by Heav'n's command."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thus, walking on, he spoke, and shew'd the gate,<BR>
Since call'd Carmental by the Roman state;<BR>
Where stood an altar, sacred to the name<BR>
Of old Carmenta, the prophetic dame,<BR>
Who to her son foretold th' Aenean race,<BR>
Sublime in fame, and Rome's imperial place:<BR>
Then shews the forest, which, in after times,<BR>
Fierce Romulus for perpetrated crimes<BR>
A sacred refuge made; with this, the shrine<BR>
Where Pan below the rock had rites divine:<BR>
Then tells of Argus' death, his murder'd guest,<BR>
Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest.<BR>
Thence, to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads;<BR>
Now roof'd with gold, then thatch'd with homely reeds.<BR>
A reverent fear (such superstition reigns<BR>
Among the rude) ev'n then possess'd the swains.<BR>
Some god, they knew- what god, they could not tell-<BR>
Did there amidst the sacred horror dwell.<BR>
Th' Arcadians thought him Jove; and said they saw<BR>
The mighty Thund'rer with majestic awe,<BR>
Who took his shield, and dealt his bolts around,<BR>
And scatter'd tempests on the teeming ground.<BR>
Then saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood<BR>
Two stately towns, on either side the flood,)<BR>
Saturnia's and Janicula's remains;<BR>
And either place the founder's name retains.<BR>
Discoursing thus together, they resort<BR>
Where poor Evander kept his country court.<BR>
They view'd the ground of Rome's litigious hall;<BR>
(Once oxen low'd, where now the lawyers bawl;)<BR>
Then, stooping, thro' the narrow gate they press'd,<BR>
When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest:<BR>
"Mean as it is, this palace, and this door,<BR>
Receiv'd Alcides, then a conqueror.<BR>
Dare to be poor; accept our homely food,<BR>
Which feasted him, and emulate a god."<BR>
Then underneath a lowly roof he led<BR>
The weary prince, and laid him on a bed;<BR>
The stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o'erspread.<BR>
Now Night had shed her silver dews around,<BR>
And with her sable wings embrac'd the ground,<BR>
When love's fair goddess, anxious for her son,<BR>
(New tumults rising, and new wars begun,)<BR>
Couch'd with her husband in his golden bed,<BR>
With these alluring words invokes his aid;<BR>
And, that her pleasing speech his mind may move,<BR>
Inspires each accent with the charms of love:<BR>
"While cruel fate conspir'd with Grecian pow'rs,<BR>
To level with the ground the Trojan tow'rs,<BR>
I ask'd not aid th' unhappy to restore,<BR>
Nor did the succor of thy skill implore;<BR>
Nor urg'd the labors of my lord in vain,<BR>
A sinking empire longer to sustain,<BR>
Tho'much I ow'd to Priam's house, and more<BR>
The dangers of Aeneas did deplore.<BR>
But now, by Jove's command, and fate's decree,<BR>
His race is doom'd to reign in Italy:<BR>
With humble suit I beg thy needful art,<BR>
O still propitious pow'r, that rules my heart!<BR>
A mother kneels a suppliant for her son.<BR>
By Thetis and Aurora thou wert won<BR>
To forge impenetrable shields, and grace<BR>
With fated arms a less illustrious race.<BR>
Behold, what haughty nations are combin'd<BR>
Against the relics of the Phrygian kind,<BR>
With fire and sword my people to destroy,<BR>
And conquer Venus twice, in conqu'ring Troy."<BR>
She said; and straight her arms, of snowy hue,<BR>
About her unresolving husband threw.<BR>
Her soft embraces soon infuse desire;<BR>
His bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire;<BR>
And all the godhead feels the wonted fire.<BR>
Not half so swift the rattling thunder flies,<BR>
Or forky lightnings flash along the skies.<BR>
The goddess, proud of her successful wiles,<BR>
And conscious of her form, in secret smiles.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then thus the pow'r, obnoxious to her charms,<BR>
Panting, and half dissolving in her arms:<BR>
"Why seek you reasons for a cause so just,<BR>
Or your own beauties or my love distrust?<BR>
Long since, had you requir'd my helpful hand,<BR>
Th' artificer and art you might command,<BR>
To labor arms for Troy: nor Jove, nor fate,<BR>
Confin'd their empire to so short a date.<BR>
And, if you now desire new wars to wage,<BR>
My skill I promise, and my pains engage.<BR>
Whatever melting metals can conspire,<BR>
Or breathing bellows, or the forming fire,<BR>
Is freely yours: your anxious fears remove,<BR>
And think no task is difficult to love."<BR>
Trembling he spoke; and, eager of her charms,<BR>
He snatch'd the willing goddess to his arms;<BR>
Till in her lap infus'd, he lay possess'd<BR>
Of full desire, and sunk to pleasing rest.<BR>
Now when the Night her middle race had rode,<BR>
And his first slumber had refresh'd the god-<BR>
The time when early housewives leave the bed;<BR>
When living embers on the hearth they spread,<BR>
Supply the lamp, and call the maids to rise-<BR>
With yawning mouths, and with half-open'd eyes,<BR>
They ply the distaff by the winking light,<BR>
And to their daily labor add the night:<BR>
Thus frugally they earn their children's bread,<BR>
And uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed-<BR>
Not less concern'd, nor at a later hour,<BR>
Rose from his downy couch the forging pow'r.<BR>

Sacred to Vulcan's name, an isle there lay,<BR>
Betwixt Sicilia's coasts and Lipare,<BR>
Rais'd high on smoking rocks; and, deep below,<BR>
In hollow caves the fires of Aetna glow.<BR>
The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal;<BR>
Loud strokes, and hissings of tormented steel,<BR>
Are heard around; the boiling waters roar,<BR>
And smoky flames thro' fuming tunnels soar.<BR>
Hether the Father of the Fire, by night,<BR>
Thro' the brown air precipitates his flight.<BR>
On their eternal anvils here he found<BR>
The brethren beating, and the blows go round.<BR>
A load of pointless thunder now there lies<BR>
Before their hands, to ripen for the skies:<BR>
These darts, for angry Jove, they daily cast;<BR>
Consum'd on mortals with prodigious waste.<BR>
Three rays of writhen rain, of fire three more,<BR>
Of winged southern winds and cloudy store<BR>
As many parts, the dreadful mixture frame;<BR>
And fears are added, and avenging flame.<BR>
Inferior ministers, for Mars, repair<BR>
His broken axletrees and blunted war,<BR>
And send him forth again with furbish'd arms,<BR>
To wake the lazy war with trumpets' loud alarms.<BR>

"My sons," said Vulcan, "set your tasks aside;<BR>
Your strength and master-skill must now be tried.<BR>
Arms for a hero forge; arms that require<BR>
Your force, your speed, and all your forming fire."<BR>
He said. They set their former work aside,<BR>
And their new toils with eager haste divide.<BR>
A flood of molten silver, brass, and gold,<BR>
And deadly steel, in the large furnace roll'd;<BR>
Of this, their artful hands a shield prepare,<BR>
Alone sufficient to sustain the war.<BR>
Sev'n orbs within a spacious round they close:<BR>
One stirs the fire, and one the bellows blows.<BR>

The grot with beaten anvils groans around.<BR>

While, at the Lemnian god's command, they urge<BR>
Their labors thus, and ply th' Aeolian forge,<BR>

He leaves his lowly bed: his buskins meet<BR>
Above his ankles; sandals sheathe his feet:<BR>
He sets his trusty sword upon his side,<BR>
And o'er his shoulder throws a panther's hide.<BR>
Two menial dogs before their master press'd.<BR>
Thus clad, and guarded thus, he seeks his kingly guest.<BR>
Mindful of promis'd aid, he mends his pace,<BR>

Th' Arcadian first their former talk renews:<BR>
"Undaunted prince, I never can believe<BR>
The Trojan empire lost, while you survive.<BR>
Command th' assistance of a faithful friend;<BR>
But feeble are the succors I can send.<BR>
Our narrow kingdom here the Tiber bounds;<BR>
That other side the Latian state surrounds,<BR>
Insults our walls, and wastes our fruitful grounds.<BR>
But mighty nations I prepare, to join<BR>
Their arms with yours, and aid your just design.<BR>
You come, as by your better genius sent,<BR>
And fortune seems to favor your intent.<BR>
Not far from hence there stands a hilly town,<BR>
Of ancient building, and of high renown,<BR>
Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race,<BR>
Who gave the name of Caere to the place,<BR>
Once Agyllina call'd. It flourish'd long,<BR>
In pride of wealth and warlike people strong,<BR>
Till curs'd Mezentius, in a fatal hour,<BR>
Assum'd the crown, with arbitrary pow'r.<BR>
What words can paint those execrable times,<BR>
The subjects' suff'rings, and the tyrant's crimes!<BR>
That blood, those murthers, O ye gods, replace<BR>
On his own head, and on his impious race!<BR>
The living and the dead at his command<BR>
Were coupled, face to face, and hand to hand,<BR>
Till, chok'd with stench, in loath'd embraces tied,<BR>
The ling'ring wretches pin'd away and died.<BR>
Thus plung'd in ills, and meditating more-<BR>
The people's patience, tir'd, no longer bore<BR>
The raging monster; but with arms beset<BR>
His house, and vengeance and destruction threat.<BR>
They fire his palace: while the flame ascends,<BR>
They force his guards, and execute his friends.<BR>
He cleaves the crowd, and, favor'd by the night,<BR>
To Turnus' friendly court directs his flight.<BR>
By just revenge the Tuscans set on fire,<BR>
With arms, their king to punishment require:<BR>
Their num'rous troops, now muster'd on the strand,<BR>
My counsel shall submit to your command.<BR>
Their navy swarms upon the coasts; they cry<BR>
To hoist their anchors, but the gods deny.<BR>
An ancient augur, skill'd in future fate,<BR>
With these foreboding words restrains their hate:<BR>
'Ye brave in arms, ye Lydian blood, the flow'r<BR>
Of Tuscan youth, and choice of all their pow'r,<BR>
Whom just revenge against Mezentius arms,<BR>
To seek your tyrant's death by lawful arms;<BR>
Know this: no native of our land may lead<BR>
This pow'rful people; seek a foreign head.'<BR>
Aw'd with these words, in camps they still abide,<BR>
And wait with longing looks their promis'd guide.<BR>
Tarchon, the Tuscan chief, to me has sent<BR>
Their crown, and ev'ry regal ornament:<BR>
The people join their own with his desire;<BR>
And all my conduct, as their king, require.<BR>
But the chill blood that creeps within my veins,<BR>
And age, and listless limbs unfit for pains,<BR>
And a soul conscious of its own decay,<BR>
Have forc'd me to refuse imperial sway.<BR>
My Pallas were more fit to mount the throne,<BR>
And should, but he's a Sabine mother's son,<BR>
And half a native; but, in you, combine<BR>
A manly vigor, and a foreign line.<BR>
Where Fate and smiling Fortune shew the way,<BR>
Pursue the ready path to sov'reign sway.<BR>
The staff of my declining days, my son,<BR>
Shall make your good or ill success his own;<BR>
In fighting fields from you shall learn to dare,<BR>
And serve the hard apprenticeship of war;<BR>
Your matchless courage and your conduct view,<BR>
And early shall begin t' admire and copy you.<BR>
Besides, two hundred horse he shall command;<BR>
Tho' few, a warlike and well-chosen band.<BR>
These in my name are listed; and my son<BR>
As many more has added in his own."<BR>

Scarce had he said; Achates and his guest,<BR>
With downcast eyes, their silent grief express'd;<BR>

Shook at the dismal prospect of the war.<BR>

To cheer her issue, thunder'd thrice aloud;<BR>
Thrice forky lightning flash'd along the sky,<BR>

My goddess mother, whose indulgent care<BR>

Fated from force of steel by Stygian charms,<BR>
Suspended, shone on high: she then foreshow'd<BR>
Approaching fights, and fields to float in blood.<BR>

Precious with studded work, and paws of gold.<BR>
Fame thro' the little city spreads aloud<BR>
Th' intended march, amid the fearful crowd:<BR>

Meantime the mother goddess, crown'd with charms,<BR>
Breaks thro' the clouds, and brings the fated arms.<BR>
Within a winding vale she finds her son,<BR>
On the cool river's banks, retir'd alone.<BR>
She shews her heav'nly form without disguise,<BR>
And gives herself to his desiring eyes.<BR>
"Behold," she said, "perform'd in ev'ry part,<BR>
My promise made, and Vulcan's labor'd art.<BR>
Now seek, secure, the Latian enemy,<BR>
And haughty Turnus to the field defy."<BR>
She said; and, having first her son embrac'd,<BR>
The radiant arms beneath an oak she plac'd,<BR>
Proud of the gift, he roll'd his greedy sight<BR>
Around the work, and gaz'd with vast delight.<BR>
He lifts, he turns, he poises, and admires<BR>
The crested helm, that vomits radiant fires:<BR>
His hands the fatal sword and corslet hold,<BR>
One keen with temper'd steel, one stiff with gold:<BR>
Both ample, flaming both, and beamy bright;<BR>
So shines a cloud, when edg'd with adverse light.<BR>
He shakes the pointed spear, and longs to try<BR>
The plated cuishes on his manly thigh;<BR>
But most admires the shield's mysterious mold,<BR>
And Roman triumphs rising on the gold:<BR>
For these, emboss'd, the heav'nly smith had wrought<BR>
(Not in the rolls of future fate untaught)<BR>
The wars in order, and the race divine<BR>
Of warriors issuing from the Julian line.<BR>
The cave of Mars was dress'd with mossy greens:<BR>
There, by the wolf, were laid the martial twins.<BR>
Intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung;<BR>
The foster dam loll'd out her fawning tongue:<BR>
They suck'd secure, while, bending back her head,<BR>
She lick'd their tender limbs, and form'd them as they fed.<BR>
Not far from thence new Rome appears, with games<BR>
Projected for the rape of Sabine dames.<BR>
The pit resounds with shrieks; a war succeeds,<BR>
For breach of public faith, and unexampled deeds.<BR>
Here for revenge the Sabine troops contend;<BR>
The Romans there with arms the prey defend.<BR>
Wearied with tedious war, at length they cease;<BR>
And both the kings and kingdoms plight the peace.<BR>
The friendly chiefs before Jove's altar stand,<BR>
Both arm'd, with each a charger in his hand:<BR>
A fatted sow for sacrifice is led,<BR>
With imprecations on the perjur'd head.<BR>
Near this, the traitor Metius, stretch'd between<BR>
Four fiery steeds, is dragg'd along the green,<BR>
By Tullus' doom: the brambles drink his blood,<BR>
And his torn limbs are left the vulture's food.<BR>
There, Porsena to Rome proud Tarquin brings,<BR>
And would by force restore the banish'd kings.<BR>
One tyrant for his fellow-tyrant fights;<BR>
The Roman youth assert their native rights.<BR>
Before the town the Tuscan army lies,<BR>
To win by famine, or by fraud surprise.<BR>
Their king, half-threat'ning, half-disdaining stood,<BR>
While Cocles broke the bridge, and stemm'd the flood.<BR>
The captive maids there tempt the raging tide,<BR>
Scap'd from their chains, with Cloelia for their guide.<BR>
High on a rock heroic Manlius stood,<BR>
To guard the temple, and the temple's god.<BR>
Then Rome was poor; and there you might behold<BR>
The palace thatch'd with straw, now roof'd with gold.<BR>
The silver goose before the shining gate<BR>
There flew, and, by her cackle, sav'd the state.<BR>
She told the Gauls' approach; th' approaching Gauls,<BR>
Obscure in night, ascend, and seize the walls.<BR>
The gold dissembled well their yellow hair,<BR>
And golden chains on their white necks they wear.<BR>
Gold are their vests; long Alpine spears they wield,<BR>
And their left arm sustains a length of shield.<BR>
Hard by, the leaping Salian priests advance;<BR>
And naked thro' the streets the mad Luperci dance,<BR>
In caps of wool; the targets dropp'd from heav'n.<BR>
Here modest matrons, in soft litters driv'n,<BR>
To pay their vows in solemn pomp appear,<BR>
And odorous gums in their chaste hands they bear.<BR>
Far hence remov'd, the Stygian seats are seen;<BR>
Pains of the damn'd, and punish'd Catiline<BR>
Hung on a rock- the traitor; and, around,<BR>
The Furies hissing from the nether ground.<BR>
Apart from these, the happy souls he draws,<BR>
And Cato's holy ghost dispensing laws.<BR>

Her country gods, the monsters of the sky,<BR>
Great Neptune, Pallas, and Love's Queen defy:<BR>
The dog Anubis barks, but barks in vain,<BR>
Nor longer dares oppose th' ethereal train.<BR>
Mars in the middle of the shining shield<BR>
Is grav'd, and strides along the liquid field.<BR>
The Dirae souse from heav'n with swift descent;<BR>

This seen, Apollo, from his Actian height,<BR>
Pours down his arrows; at whose winged flight<BR>

And soft Sabaeans quit the wat'ry field.<BR>
The fatal mistress hoists her silken sails,<BR>
And, shrinking from the fight, invokes the gales.<BR>
Aghast she looks, and heaves her breast for breath,<BR>
Panting, and pale with fear of future death.<BR>

By winds and waves, and scudding thro' the throng.<BR>
Just opposite, sad Nilus opens wide<BR>
His arms and ample bosom to the tide,<BR>

In which he wraps his queen, and hides the flying host.<BR>

Drench'd in his gore, the destin'd sacrifice.<BR>
Great Caesar sits sublime upon his throne,<BR>
Before Apollo's porch of Parian stone;<BR>
Accepts the presents vow'd for victory,<BR>
And hangs the monumental crowns on high.<BR>
Vast crowds of vanquish'd nations march along,<BR>

Amaz'd to find a dastard race, that run<BR>
Behind the rampires and the battle shun,<BR>
He rides around the camp, with rolling eyes,<BR>
And stops at ev'ry post, and ev'ry passage tries.<BR>
So roams the nightly wolf about the fold:<BR>
Wet with descending show'rs, and stiff with cold,<BR>
He howls for hunger, and he grins for pain,<BR>
(His gnashing teeth are exercis'd in vain,)<BR>
And, impotent of anger, finds no way<BR>
In his distended paws to grasp the prey.<BR>
The mothers listen; but the bleating lambs<BR>
Securely swig the dug, beneath the dams.<BR>
Thus ranges eager Turnus o'er the plain.<BR>
Sharp with desire, and furious with disdain;<BR>
Surveys each passage with a piercing sight,<BR>
To force his foes in equal field to fight.<BR>
Thus while he gazes round, at length he spies,<BR>
Where, fenc'd with strong redoubts, their navy lies,<BR>
Close underneath the walls; the washing tide<BR>
Secures from all approach this weaker side.<BR>
He takes the wish'd occasion, fills his hand<BR>
With ready fires, and shakes a flaming brand.<BR>
Urg'd by his presence, ev'ry soul is warm'd,<BR>
And ev'ry hand with kindled firs is arm'd.<BR>
From the fir'd pines the scatt'ring sparkles fly;<BR>
Fat vapors, mix'd with flames, involve the sky.<BR>
What pow'r, O Muses, could avert the flame<BR>
Which threaten'd, in the fleet, the Trojan name?<BR>
Tell: for the fact, thro' length of time obscure,<BR>
Is hard to faith; yet shall the fame endure.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
'T is said that, when the chief prepar'd his flight,<BR>
And fell'd his timber from Mount Ida's height,<BR>
The grandam goddess then approach'd her son,<BR>
And with a mother's majesty begun:<BR>
"Grant me," she said, "the sole request I bring,<BR>
Since conquer'd heav'n has own'd you for its king.<BR>
On Ida's brows, for ages past, there stood,<BR>
With firs and maples fill'd, a shady wood;<BR>
And on the summit rose a sacred grove,<BR>
Where I was worship'd with religious love.<BR>
Those woods, that holy grove, my long delight,<BR>
I gave the Trojan prince, to speed his flight.<BR>
Now, fill'd with fear, on their behalf I come;<BR>
Let neither winds o'erset, nor waves intomb<BR>
The floating forests of the sacred pine;<BR>
But let it be their safety to be mine."<BR>
Then thus replied her awful son, who rolls<BR>
The radiant stars, and heav'n and earth controls:<BR>
"How dare you, mother, endless date demand<BR>
For vessels molded by a mortal hand?<BR>
What then is fate? Shall bold Aeneas ride,<BR>
Of safety certain, on th' uncertain tide?<BR>
Yet, what I can, I grant; when, wafted o'er,<BR>
The chief is landed on the Latian shore,<BR>
Whatever ships escape the raging storms,<BR>
At my command shall change their fading forms<BR>
To nymphs divine, and plow the wat'ry way,<BR>
Like Dotis and the daughters of the sea."<BR>
To seal his sacred vow, by Styx he swore,<BR>
The lake of liquid pitch, the dreary shore,<BR>
And Phlegethon's innavigable flood,<BR>
And the black regions of his brother god.<BR>
He said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And now at length the number'd hours were come,<BR>
Prefix'd by fate's irrevocable doom,<BR>
When the great Mother of the Gods was free<BR>
To save her ships, and finish Jove's decree.<BR>
First, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung<BR>
A light that sign'd the heav'ns, and shot along;<BR>
Then from a cloud, fring'd round with golden fires,<BR>
Were timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs;<BR>
And, last, a voice, with more than mortal sounds,<BR>
Both hosts, in arms oppos'd, with equal horror wounds:<BR>
"O Trojan race, your needless aid forbear,<BR>
And know, my ships are my peculiar care.<BR>
With greater ease the bold Rutulian may,<BR>
With hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea,<BR>
Than singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge,<BR>
Loos'd from your crooked anchors, launch at large,<BR>
Exalted each a nymph: forsake the sand,<BR>
And swim the seas, at Cybele's command."<BR>
No sooner had the goddess ceas'd to speak,<BR>
When, lo! th' obedient ships their haulsers break;<BR>
And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main<BR>
They plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again:<BR>
As many beauteous maids the billows sweep,<BR>
As rode before tall vessels on the deep.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The foes, surpris'd with wonder, stood aghast;<BR>
Messapus curb'd his fiery courser's haste;<BR>
Old Tiber roar'd, and, raising up his head,<BR>
Call'd back his waters to their oozy bed.<BR>
Turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock,<BR>
And with these words his trembling troops bespoke:<BR>
"These monsters for the Trojans' fate are meant,<BR>
And are by Jove for black presages sent.<BR>
He takes the cowards' last relief away;<BR>
For fly they cannot, and, constrain'd to stay,<BR>
Must yield unfought, a base inglorious prey.<BR>
The liquid half of all the globe is lost;<BR>
Heav'n shuts the seas, and we secure the coast.<BR>
Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground<BR>
Which myriads of our martial men surround.<BR>
Their fates I fear not, or vain oracles.<BR>
'T was giv'n to Venus they should cross the seas,<BR>
And land secure upon the Latian plains:<BR>
Their promis'd hour is pass'd, and mine remains.<BR>
'T is in the fate of Turnus to destroy,<BR>
With sword and fire, the faithless race of Troy.<BR>
Shall such affronts as these alone inflame<BR>
The Grecian brothers, and the Grecian name?<BR>
My cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife,<BR>
And final ruin, for a ravish'd wife.<BR>
Was 't not enough, that, punish'd for the crime,<BR>
They fell; but will they fall a second time?<BR>
One would have thought they paid enough before,<BR>
To curse the costly sex, and durst offend no more.<BR>
Can they securely trust their feeble wall,<BR>
A slight partition, a thin interval,<BR>
Betwixt their fate and them; when Troy, tho' built<BR>
By hands divine, yet perish'd by their guilt?<BR>
Lend me, for once, my friends, your valiant hands,<BR>
To force from out their lines these dastard bands.<BR>
Less than a thousand ships will end this war,<BR>
Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare.<BR>
Let all the Tuscans, all th' Arcadians, join!<BR>
Nor these, nor those, shall frustrate my design.<BR>
Let them not fear the treasons of the night,<BR>
The robb'd Palladium, the pretended flight:<BR>
Our onset shall be made in open light.<BR>
No wooden engine shall their town betray;<BR>
Fires they shall have around, but fires by day.<BR>
No Grecian babes before their camp appear,<BR>
Whom Hector's arms detain'd to the tenth tardy year.<BR>
Now, since the sun is rolling to the west,<BR>
Give we the silent night to needful rest:<BR>
Refresh your bodies, and your arms prepare;<BR>
The morn shall end the small remains of war."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The post of honor to Messapus falls,<BR>
To keep the nightly guard, to watch the walls,<BR>
To pitch the fires at distances around,<BR>
And close the Trojans in their scanty ground.<BR>
Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand,<BR>
And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command;<BR>
All clad in shining arms the works invest,<BR>
Each with a radiant helm and waving crest.<BR>
Stretch'd at their length, they press the grassy ground;<BR>
They laugh, they sing, (the jolly bowls go round,)<BR>
With lights and cheerful fires renew the day,<BR>
And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The Trojans, from above, their foes beheld,<BR>
And with arm'd legions all the rampires fill'd.<BR>
Seiz'd with affright, their gates they first explore;<BR>
Join works to works with bridges, tow'r to tow'r:<BR>
Thus all things needful for defense abound.<BR>
Mnestheus and brave Seresthus walk the round,<BR>
Commission'd by their absent prince to share<BR>
The common danger, and divide the care.<BR>
The soldiers draw their lots, and, as they fall,<BR>
By turns relieve each other on the wall.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance,<BR>
To watch the gate was warlike Nisus' chance.<BR>
His father Hyrtacus of noble blood;<BR>
His mother was a huntress of the wood,<BR>
And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear<BR>
His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear,<BR>
But better skill'd unerring shafts to send.<BR>
Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend:<BR>
Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host<BR>
No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast-<BR>
Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun.<BR>
One was their care, and their delight was one:<BR>
One common hazard in the war they shar'd,<BR>
And now were both by choice upon the guard.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then Nisus thus: "Or do the gods inspire<BR>
This warmth, or make we gods of our desire?<BR>
A gen'rous ardor boils within my breast,<BR>
Eager of action, enemy to rest:<BR>
This urges me to fight, and fires my mind<BR>
To leave a memorable name behind.<BR>
Thou see'st the foe secure; how faintly shine<BR>
Their scatter'd fires! the most, in sleep supine<BR>
Along the ground, an easy conquest lie:<BR>
The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply;<BR>
All hush'd around. Now hear what I revolve-<BR>
A thought unripe- and scarcely yet resolve.<BR>
Our absent prince both camp and council mourn;<BR>
By message both would hasten his return:<BR>
If they confer what I demand on thee,<BR>
(For fame is recompense enough for me,)<BR>
Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied<BR>
A way that safely will my passage guide."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Euryalus stood list'ning while he spoke,<BR>
With love of praise and noble envy struck;<BR>
Then to his ardent friend expos'd his mind:<BR>
"All this, alone, and leaving me behind!<BR>
Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be join'd?<BR>
Thinkist thou I can my share of glory yield,<BR>
Or send thee unassisted to the field?<BR>
Not so my father taught my childhood arms;<BR>
Born in a siege, and bred among alarms!<BR>
Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend,<BR>
Nor of the heav'n-born hero I attend.<BR>
The thing call'd life, with ease I can disclaim,<BR>
And think it over-sold to purchase fame."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then Nisus thus: "Alas! thy tender years<BR>
Would minister new matter to my fears.<BR>
So may the gods, who view this friendly strife,<BR>
Restore me to thy lov'd embrace with life,<BR>
Condemn'd to pay my vows, (as sure I trust,)<BR>
This thy request is cruel and unjust.<BR>
But if some chance- as many chances are,<BR>
And doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war-<BR>
If one should reach my head, there let it fall,<BR>
And spare thy life; I would not perish all.<BR>
Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date:<BR>
Live thou to mourn thy love's unhappy fate;<BR>
To bear my mangled body from the foe,<BR>
Or buy it back, and fun'ral rites bestow.<BR>
Or, if hard fortune shall those dues deny,<BR>
Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply.<BR>
O let not me the widow's tears renew!<BR>
Nor let a mother's curse my name pursue:<BR>
Thy pious parent, who, for love of thee,<BR>
Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily,<BR>
Her age committing to the seas and wind,<BR>
When ev'ry weary matron stay'd behind."<BR>
To this, Euryalus: "You plead in vain,<BR>
And but protract the cause you cannot gain.<BR>
No more delays, but haste!" With that, he wakes<BR>
The nodding watch; each to his office takes.<BR>
The guard reliev'd, the gen'rous couple went<BR>
To find the council at the royal tent.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
All creatures else forgot their daily care,<BR>
And sleep, the common gift of nature, share;<BR>
Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate<BR>
In nightly council for th' indanger'd state.<BR>
They vote a message to their absent chief,<BR>
Shew their distress, and beg a swift relief.<BR>
Amid the camp a silent seat they chose,<BR>
Remote from clamor, and secure from foes.<BR>
On their left arms their ample shields they bear,<BR>
The right reclin'd upon the bending spear.<BR>
Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard,<BR>
And beg admission, eager to be heard:<BR>
Th' affair important, not to be deferr'd.<BR>
Ascanius bids 'em be conducted in,<BR>
Ord'ring the more experienc'd to begin.<BR>
Then Nisus thus: "Ye fathers, lend your ears;<BR>
Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years.<BR>
The foe, securely drench'd in sleep and wine,<BR>
Neglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine;<BR>
And where the smoke in cloudy vapors flies,<BR>
Cov'ring the plain, and curling to the skies,<BR>
Betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide,<BR>
Close by the sea, a passage we have spied,<BR>
Which will our way to great Aeneas guide.<BR>
Expect each hour to see him safe again,<BR>
Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain.<BR>
Snatch we the lucky minute while we may;<BR>
Nor can we be mistaken in the way;<BR>
For, hunting in the vale, we both have seen<BR>
The rising turrets, and the stream between,<BR>
And know the winding course, with ev'ry ford."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He ceas'd; and old Alethes took the word:<BR>
"Our country gods, in whom our trust we place,<BR>
Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race,<BR>
While we behold such dauntless worth appear<BR>
In dawning youth, and souls so void of fear."<BR>
Then into tears of joy the father broke;<BR>
Each in his longing arms by turns he took;<BR>
Panted and paus'd; and thus again he spoke:<BR>
"Ye brave young men, what equal gifts can we,<BR>
In recompense of such desert, decree?<BR>
The greatest, sure, and best you can receive,<BR>
The gods and your own conscious worth will give.<BR>
The rest our grateful gen'ral will bestow,<BR>
And young Ascanius till his manhood owe."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"And I, whose welfare in my father lies,"<BR>
Ascanius adds, "by the great deities,<BR>
By my dear country, by my household gods,<BR>
By hoary Vesta's rites and dark abodes,<BR>
Adjure you both, (on you my fortune stands;<BR>
That and my faith I plight into your hands,)<BR>
Make me but happy in his safe return,<BR>
Whose wanted presence I can only mourn;<BR>
Your common gift shall two large goblets be<BR>
Of silver, wrought with curious imagery,<BR>
And high emboss'd, which, when old Priam reign'd,<BR>
My conqu'ring sire at sack'd Arisba gain'd;<BR>
And more, two tripods cast in antic mold,<BR>
With two great talents of the finest gold;<BR>
Beside a costly bowl, ingrav'd with art,<BR>
Which Dido gave, when first she gave her heart.<BR>
But, if in conquer'd Italy we reign,<BR>
When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain-<BR>
Thou saw'st the courser by proud Turnus press'd:<BR>
That, Nisus, and his arms, and nodding crest,<BR>
And shield, from chance exempt, shall be thy share:<BR>
Twelve lab'ring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair<BR>
All clad in rich attire, and train'd with care;<BR>
And, last, a Latian field with fruitful plains,<BR>
And a large portion of the king's domains.<BR>
But thou, whose years are more to mine allied-<BR>
No fate my vow'd affection shall divide<BR>
From thee, heroic youth! Be wholly mine;<BR>
Take full possession; all my soul is thine.<BR>
One faith, one fame, one fate, shall both attend;<BR>
My life's companion, and my bosom friend:<BR>
My peace shall be committed to thy care,<BR>
And to thy conduct my concerns in war."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then thus the young Euryalus replied:<BR>
"Whatever fortune, good or bad, betide,<BR>
The same shall be my age, as now my youth;<BR>
No time shall find me wanting to my truth.<BR>
This only from your goodness let me gain<BR>
(And, this ungranted, all rewards are vain)<BR>
Of Priam's royal race my mother came-<BR>
And sure the best that ever bore the name-<BR>
Whom neither Troy nor Sicily could hold<BR>
From me departing, but, o'erspent and old,<BR>
My fate she follow'd. Ignorant of this<BR>
(Whatever) danger, neither parting kiss,<BR>
Nor pious blessing taken, her I leave,<BR>
And in this only act of all my life deceive.<BR>
By this right hand and conscious Night I swear,<BR>
My soul so sad a farewell could not bear.<BR>
Be you her comfort; fill my vacant place<BR>
(Permit me to presume so great a grace)<BR>
Support her age, forsaken and distress'd.<BR>
That hope alone will fortify my breast<BR>
Against the worst of fortunes, and of fears."<BR>
He said. The mov'd assistants melt in tears.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then thus Ascanius, wonderstruck to see<BR>
That image of his filial piety:<BR>
"So great beginnings, in so green an age,<BR>
Exact the faith which I again ingage.<BR>
Thy mother all the dues shall justly claim,<BR>
Creusa had, and only want the name.<BR>
Whate'er event thy bold attempt shall have,<BR>
'T is merit to have borne a son so brave.<BR>
Now by my head, a sacred oath, I swear,<BR>
(My father us'd it,) what, returning here<BR>
Crown'd with success, I for thyself prepare,<BR>
That, if thou fail, shall thy lov'd mother share."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He said, and weeping, while he spoke the word,<BR>
From his broad belt he drew a shining sword,<BR>
Magnificent with gold. Lycaon made,<BR>
And in an ivory scabbard sheath'd the blade.<BR>
This was his gift. Great Mnestheus gave his friend<BR>
A lion's hide, his body to defend;<BR>
And good Alethes furnish'd him, beside,<BR>
With his own trusty helm, of temper tried.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thus arm'd they went. The noble Trojans wait<BR>
Their issuing forth, and follow to the gate<BR>
With prayers and vows. Above the rest appears<BR>
Ascanius, manly far beyond his years,<BR>
And messages committed to their care,<BR>
Which all in winds were lost, and flitting air.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The trenches first they pass'd; then took their way<BR>
Where their proud foes in pitch'd pavilions lay;<BR>
To many fatal, ere themselves were slain.<BR>
They found the careless host dispers'd upon the plain,<BR>
Who, gorg'd, and drunk with wine, supinely snore.<BR>
Unharness'd chariots stand along the shore:<BR>
Amidst the wheels and reins, the goblet by,<BR>
A medley of debauch and war, they lie.<BR>
Observing Nisus shew'd his friend the sight:<BR>
"Behold a conquest gain'd without a fight.<BR>
Occasion offers, and I stand prepar'd;<BR>
There lies our way; be thou upon the guard,<BR>
And look around, while I securely go,<BR>
And hew a passage thro' the sleeping foe."<BR>
Softly he spoke; then striding took his way,<BR>
With his drawn sword, where haughty Rhamnes lay;<BR>
His head rais'd high on tapestry beneath,<BR>
And heaving from his breast, he drew his breath;<BR>
A king and prophet, by King Turnus lov'd:<BR>
But fate by prescience cannot be remov'd.<BR>
Him and his sleeping slaves he slew; then spies<BR>
Where Remus, with his rich retinue, lies.<BR>
His armor-bearer first, and next he kills<BR>
His charioteer, intrench'd betwixt the wheels<BR>
And his lov'd horses; last invades their lord;<BR>
Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword:<BR>
The gasping head flies off; a purple flood<BR>
Flows from the trunk, that welters in the blood,<BR>
Which, by the spurning heels dispers'd around,<BR>
The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground.<BR>
Lamus the bold, and Lamyrus the strong,<BR>
He slew, and then Serranus fair and young.<BR>
From dice and wine the youth retir'd to rest,<BR>
And puff'd the fumy god from out his breast:<BR>
Ev'n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play-<BR>
More lucky, had it lasted till the day.<BR>
The famish'd lion thus, with hunger bold,<BR>
O'erleaps the fences of the nightly fold,<BR>
And tears the peaceful flocks: with silent awe<BR>
Trembling they lie, and pant beneath his paw.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Nor with less rage Euryalus employs<BR>
The wrathful sword, or fewer foes destroys;<BR>
But on th' ignoble crowd his fury flew;<BR>
He Fadus, Hebesus, and Rhoetus slew.<BR>
Oppress'd with heavy sleep the former fell,<BR>
But Rhoetus wakeful, and observing all:<BR>
Behind a spacious jar he slink'd for fear;<BR>
The fatal iron found and reach'd him there;<BR>
For, as he rose, it pierc'd his naked side,<BR>
And, reeking, thence return'd in crimson dyed.<BR>
The wound pours out a stream of wine and blood;<BR>
The purple soul comes floating in the flood.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now, where Messapus quarter'd, they arrive.<BR>
The fires were fainting there, and just alive;<BR>
The warrior-horses, tied in order, fed.<BR>
Nisus observ'd the discipline, and said:<BR>
"Our eager thirst of blood may both betray;<BR>
And see the scatter'd streaks of dawning day,<BR>
Foe to nocturnal thefts. No more, my friend;<BR>
Here let our glutted execution end.<BR>
A lane thro' slaughter'd bodies we have made."<BR>
The bold Euryalus, tho' loth, obey'd.<BR>
Of arms, and arras, and of plate, they find<BR>
A precious load; but these they leave behind.<BR>
Yet, fond of gaudy spoils, the boy would stay<BR>
To make the rich caparison his prey,<BR>
Which on the steed of conquer'd Rhamnes lay.<BR>
Nor did his eyes less longingly behold<BR>
The girdle-belt, with nails of burnish'd gold.<BR>
This present Caedicus the rich bestow'd<BR>
On Remulus, when friendship first they vow'd,<BR>
And, absent, join'd in hospitable ties:<BR>
He, dying, to his heir bequeath'd the prize;<BR>
Till, by the conqu'ring Ardean troops oppress'd,<BR>
He fell; and they the glorious gift possess'd.<BR>
These glitt'ring spoils (now made the victor's gain)<BR>
He to his body suits, but suits in vain:<BR>
Messapus' helm he finds among the rest,<BR>
And laces on, and wears the waving crest.<BR>
Proud of their conquest, prouder of their prey,<BR>
They leave the camp, and take the ready way.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But far they had not pass'd, before they spied<BR>
Three hundred horse, with Volscens for their guide.<BR>
The queen a legion to King Turnus sent;<BR>
But the swift horse the slower foot prevent,<BR>
And now, advancing, sought the leader's tent.<BR>
They saw the pair; for, thro' the doubtful shade,<BR>
His shining helm Euryalus betray'd,<BR>
On which the moon with full reflection play'd.<BR>
"'T is not for naught," cried Volscens from the crowd,<BR>
"These men go there;" then rais'd his voice aloud:<BR>
"Stand! stand! why thus in arms? And whither bent?<BR>
From whence, to whom, and on what errand sent?"<BR>
Silent they scud away, and haste their flight<BR>
To neighb'ring woods, and trust themselves to night.<BR>
The speedy horse all passages belay,<BR>
And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way,<BR>
And watch each entrance of the winding wood.<BR>
Black was the forest: thick with beech it stood,<BR>
Horrid with fern, and intricate with thorn;<BR>
Few paths of human feet, or tracks of beasts, were worn.<BR>
The darkness of the shades, his heavy prey,<BR>
And fear, misled the younger from his way.<BR>
But Nisus hit the turns with happier haste,<BR>
And, thoughtless of his friend, the forest pass'd,<BR>
And Alban plains, from Alba's name so call'd,<BR>
Where King Latinus then his oxen stall'd;<BR>
Till, turning at the length, he stood his ground,<BR>
And miss'd his friend, and cast his eyes around:<BR>
"Ah wretch!" he cried, "where have I left behind<BR>
Th' unhappy youth? where shall I hope to find?<BR>
Or what way take?" Again he ventures back,<BR>
And treads the mazes of his former track.<BR>
He winds the wood, and, list'ning, hears the noise<BR>
Of tramping coursers, and the riders' voice.<BR>
The sound approach'd; and suddenly he view'd<BR>
The foes inclosing, and his friend pursued,<BR>
Forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain<BR>
The shelter of the friendly shades to gain.<BR>
What should he next attempt? what arms employ,<BR>
What fruitless force, to free the captive boy?<BR>
Or desperate should he rush and lose his life,<BR>
With odds oppress'd, in such unequal strife?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Resolv'd at length, his pointed spear he shook;<BR>
And, casting on the moon a mournful look:<BR>
"Guardian of groves, and goddess of the night,<BR>
Fair queen," he said, "direct my dart aright.<BR>
If e'er my pious father, for my sake,<BR>
Did grateful off'rings on thy altars make,<BR>
Or I increas'd them with my sylvan toils,<BR>
And hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils,<BR>
Give me to scatter these." Then from his ear<BR>
He pois'd, and aim'd, and launch'd the trembling spear.<BR>
The deadly weapon, hissing from the grove,<BR>
Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove;<BR>
Pierc'd his thin armor, drank his vital blood,<BR>
And in his body left the broken wood.<BR>
He staggers round; his eyeballs roll in death,<BR>
And with short sobs he gasps away his breath.<BR>
All stand amaz'd- a second jav'lin flies<BR>
With equal strength, and quivers thro' the skies.<BR>
This thro' thy temples, Tagus, forc'd the way,<BR>
And in the brainpan warmly buried lay.<BR>
Fierce Volscens foams with rage, and, gazing round,<BR>
Descried not him who gave the fatal wound,<BR>
Nor knew to fix revenge: "But thou," he cries,<BR>
"Shalt pay for both," and at the pris'ner flies<BR>
With his drawn sword. Then, struck with deep despair,<BR>
That cruel sight the lover could not bear;<BR>
But from his covert rush'd in open view,<BR>
And sent his voice before him as he flew:<BR>
"Me! me!" he cried- "turn all your swords alone<BR>
On me- the fact confess'd, the fault my own.<BR>
He neither could nor durst, the guiltless youth:<BR>
Ye moon and stars, bear witness to the truth!<BR>
His only crime (if friendship can offend)<BR>
Is too much love to his unhappy friend."<BR>
Too late he speaks: the sword, which fury guides,<BR>
Driv'n with full force, had pierc'd his tender sides.<BR>
Down fell the beauteous youth: the yawning wound<BR>

Despair, and rage, and vengeance justly vow'd,<BR>
Drove Nisus headlong on the hostile crowd.<BR>
Volscens he seeks; on him alone he bends:<BR>
Borne back and bor'd by his surrounding friends,<BR>
Onward he press'd, and kept him still in sight;<BR>
Then whirl'd aloft his sword with all his might:<BR>
Th' unerring steel descended while he spoke,<BR>
Piered his wide mouth, and thro' his weazon broke.<BR>
Dying, he slew; and, stagg'ring on the plain,<BR>

Content, in death, to be reveng'd so well.<BR>

Not one kind kiss from a departing son!<BR>
No look, no last adieu before he went,<BR>
In an ill-boding hour to slaughter sent!<BR>
Cold on the ground, and pressing foreign clay,<BR>
To Latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey!<BR>

To wash his wounds, to weep his obsequies,<BR>
To call about his corpse his crying friends,<BR>
Or spread the mantle (made for other ends)<BR>
On his dear body, which I wove with care,<BR>
Nor did my daily pains or nightly labor spare.<BR>
Where shall I find his corpse? what earth sustains<BR>
His trunk dismember'd, and his cold remains?<BR>
For this, alas! I left my needful ease,<BR>

Unman their courage, and augment their fears;<BR>

Shorter and shorter ev'ry gasp he takes;<BR>
And vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes.<BR>
Plung'd in the flood, and made the waters fly.<BR>
The yellow god the welcome burthen bore,<BR>

Why this protracted war, when my commands<BR>
Pronounc'd a peace, and gave the Latian lands?<BR>
What fear or hope on either part divides<BR>
Our heav'ns, and arms our powers on diff'rent sides?<BR>
A lawful time of war at length will come,<BR>
(Nor need your haste anticipate the doom),<BR>
When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome,<BR>
Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains,<BR>
And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains.<BR>

Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge;<BR>

"O pow'r immense, eternal energy,<BR>

Seest thou the proud Rutulians, how they dare<BR>
In fields, unpunish'd, and insult my care?<BR>
How lofty Turnus vaunts amidst his train,<BR>
In shining arms, triumphant on the plain?<BR>
Ev'n in their lines and trenches they contend,<BR>
And scarce their walls the Trojan troops defend:<BR>
The town is fill'd with slaughter, and o'erfloats,<BR>
With a red deluge, their increasing moats.<BR>
Aeneas, ignorant, and far from thence,<BR>
Has left a camp expos'd, without defense.<BR>
This endless outrage shall they still sustain?<BR>
Shall Troy renew'd be forc'd and fir'd again?<BR>
A second siege my banish'd issue fears,<BR>
And a new Diomede in arms appears.<BR>
One more audacious mortal will be found;<BR>
And I, thy daughter, wait another wound.<BR>
Yet, if with fates averse, without thy leave,<BR>
The Latian lands my progeny receive,<BR>
Bear they the pains of violated law,<BR>
And thy protection from their aid withdraw.<BR>
But, if the gods their sure success foretell;<BR>
If those of heav'n consent with those of hell,<BR>
To promise Italy; who dare debate<BR>
The pow'r of Jove, or fix another fate?<BR>
What should I tell of tempests on the main,<BR>
Of Aeolus usurping Neptune's reign?<BR>
Of Iris sent, with Bacchanalian heat<BR>
T' inspire the matrons, and destroy the fleet?<BR>
Now Juno to the Stygian sky descends,<BR>
Solicits hell for aid, and arms the fiends.<BR>

Alecto, rais'd by her, with rage inflames<BR>

Imperial sway no more exalts my mind;<BR>

And conquer they, whom you with conquest grace.<BR>
Since you can spare, from all your wide command,<BR>
No spot of earth, no hospitable land,<BR>
Which may my wand'ring fugitives receive;<BR>
(Since haughty Juno will not give you leave;)<BR>
Then, father, (if I still may use that name,)<BR>
By ruin'd Troy, yet smoking from the flame,<BR>
I beg you, let Ascanius, by my care,<BR>
Be freed from danger, and dismiss'd the war:<BR>
Inglorious let him live, without a crown.<BR>
The father may be cast on coasts unknown,<BR>
Struggling with fate; but let me save the son.<BR>
Mine is Cythera, mine the Cyprian tow'rs:<BR>
In those recesses, and those sacred bow'rs,<BR>
Obscurely let him rest; his right resign<BR>
To promis'd empire, and his Julian line.<BR>
Then Carthage may th' Ausonian towns destroy,<BR>
Nor fear the race of a rejected boy.<BR>
What profits it my son to scape the fire,<BR>
Arm'd with his gods, and loaded with his sire;<BR>
To pass the perils of the seas and wind;<BR>
Evade the Greeks, and leave the war behind;<BR>
To reach th' Italian shores; if, after all,<BR>
Our second Pergamus is doom'd to fall?<BR>
Much better had he curb'd his high desires,<BR>

Advance in order on the Latian coast:<BR>
To cut their way the Daunian chief designs,<BR>
Before their troops can reach the Trojan lines.<BR>
Thou, when the rosy morn restores the light,<BR>
First arm thy soldiers for th' ensuing fight:<BR>
Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield,<BR>
And bear aloft th' impenetrable shield.<BR>
To-morrow's sun, unless my skill be vain,<BR>
Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain."<BR>
Parting, she spoke; and with immortal force<BR>
Push'd on the vessel in her wat'ry course;<BR>
For well she knew the way. Impell'd behind,<BR>
The ship flew forward, and outstripp'd the wind.<BR>
The rest make up. Unknowing of the cause,<BR>

And, where no ford he finds, no water fries,<BR>

Halesus, next, the bold Aurunci leads:<BR>
The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds,<BR>
Conspicuous on his horse. On either hand,<BR>
These fight to keep, and those to win, the land.<BR>
With mutual blood th' Ausonian soil is dyed,<BR>
While on its borders each their claim decide.<BR>
As wintry winds, contending in the sky,<BR>
With equal force of lungs their titles try:<BR>
They rage, they roar; the doubtful rack of heav'n<BR>
Stands without motion, and the tide undriv'n:<BR>
Each bent to conquer, neither side to yield,<BR>
They long suspend the fortune of the field.<BR>
Both armies thus perform what courage can;<BR>
Foot set to foot, and mingled man to man.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
But, in another part, th' Arcadian horse<BR>
With ill success ingage the Latin force:<BR>
For, where th' impetuous torrent, rushing down,<BR>
Huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown,<BR>
They left their coursers, and, unus'd to fight<BR>
On foot, were scatter'd in a shameful flight.<BR>
Pallas, who with disdain and grief had view'd<BR>
His foes pursuing, and his friends pursued,<BR>
Us'd threat'nings mix'd with pray'rs, his last resource,<BR>
With these to move their minds, with those to fire their force<BR>
"Which way, companions? whether would you run?<BR>
By you yourselves, and mighty battles won,<BR>
By my great sire, by his establish'd name,<BR>
And early promise of my future fame;<BR>
By my youth, emulous of equal right<BR>
To share his honors- shun ignoble flight!<BR>
Trust not your feet: your hands must hew way<BR>
Thro' yon black body, and that thick array:<BR>
'T is thro' that forward path that we must come;<BR>
There lies our way, and that our passage home.<BR>
Nor pow'rs above, nor destinies below<BR>
Oppress our arms: with equal strength we go,<BR>
With mortal hands to meet a mortal foe.<BR>
See on what foot we stand: a scanty shore,<BR>
The sea behind, our enemies before;<BR>
No passage left, unless we swim the main;<BR>
Or, forcing these, the Trojan trenches gain."<BR>
This said, he strode with eager haste along,<BR>
And bore amidst the thickest of the throng.<BR>
Lagus, the first he met, with fate to foe,<BR>
Had heav'd a stone of mighty weight, to throw:<BR>
Stooping, the spear descended on his chine,<BR>
Just where the bone distinguished either loin:<BR>
It stuck so fast, so deeply buried lay,<BR>
That scarce the victor forc'd the steel away.<BR>
Hisbon came on: but, while he mov'd too slow<BR>
To wish'd revenge, the prince prevents his blow;<BR>
For, warding his at once, at once he press'd,<BR>
And plung'd the fatal weapon in his breast.<BR>
Then lewd Anchemolus he laid in dust,<BR>
Who stain'd his stepdam's bed with impious lust.<BR>
And, after him, the Daucian twins were slain,<BR>
Laris and Thymbrus, on the Latian plain;<BR>
So wondrous like in feature, shape, and size,<BR>
As caus'd an error in their parents' eyes-<BR>
Grateful mistake! but soon the sword decides<BR>
The nice distinction, and their fate divides:<BR>
For Thymbrus' head was lopp'd; and Laris' hand,<BR>
Dismember'd, sought its owner on the strand:<BR>
The trembling fingers yet the fauchion strain,<BR>
And threaten still th' intended stroke in vain.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now, to renew the charge, th' Arcadians came:<BR>
Sight of such acts, and sense of honest shame,<BR>
And grief, with anger mix'd, their minds inflame.<BR>
Then, with a casual blow was Rhoeteus slain,<BR>
Who chanc'd, as Pallas threw, to cross the plain:<BR>
The flying spear was after Ilus sent;<BR>
But Rhoeteus happen'd on a death unmeant:<BR>
From Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled,<BR>
The lance, athwart his body, laid him dead:<BR>
Roll'd from his chariot with a mortal wound,<BR>
And intercepted fate, he spurn'd the ground.<BR>
As when, in summer, welcome winds arise,<BR>
The watchful shepherd to the forest flies,<BR>
And fires the midmost plants; contagion spreads,<BR>
And catching flames infect the neighb'ring heads;<BR>
Around the forest flies the furious blast,<BR>
And all the leafy nation sinks at last,<BR>
And Vulcan rides in triumph o'er the waste;<BR>
The pastor, pleas'd with his dire victory,<BR>
Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky:<BR>
So Pallas' troops their scatter'd strength unite,<BR>

Halesus came, fierce with desire of blood;<BR>
But first collected in his arms he stood:<BR>

Ladon, Demodocus, and Pheres fell.<BR>

And from Strymonius hew'd his better hand,<BR>
Held up to guard his throat; then hurl'd a stone<BR>
At Thoas' ample front, and pierc'd the bone:<BR>
It struck beneath the space of either eye;<BR>
And blood, and mingled brains, together fly.<BR>
Deep skill'd in future fates, Halesus' sire<BR>
Did with the youth to lonely groves retire:<BR>
But, when the father's mortal race was run,<BR>
Dire destiny laid hold upon the son,<BR>
And haul'd him to the war, to find, beneath<BR>
Th' Evandrian spear, a memorable death.<BR>
Pallas th' encounter seeks, but, ere he throws,<BR>
To Tuscan Tiber thus address'd his vows:<BR>
"O sacred stream, direct my flying dart,<BR>
And give to pass the proud Halesus' heart!<BR>
His arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear."<BR>
Pleas'd with the bribe, the god receiv'd his pray'r:<BR>

The dart came driving on, and pierc'd his breast.<BR>

The Phrygian troops escap'd the Greeks in vain:<BR>
They, and their mix'd allies, now load the plain.<BR>
To the rude shock of war both armies came;<BR>
Their leaders equal, and their strength the same.<BR>
The rear so press'd the front, they could not wield<BR>
Their angry weapons, to dispute the field.<BR>
Here Pallas urges on, and Lausus there:<BR>

From the forbidden space his men retir'd.<BR>
Pallas their awe, and his stern words, admir'd;<BR>

Struck with his haughty mien, and tow'ring height.<BR>
Then to the king: "Your empty vaunts forbear;<BR>
Success I hope, and fate I cannot fear;<BR>
Alive or dead, I shall deserve a name;<BR>
Jove is impartial, and to both the same."<BR>
He said, and to the void advanc'd his pace:<BR>
Pale horror sate on each Arcadian face.<BR>
Then Turnus, from his chariot leaping light,<BR>
Address'd himself on foot to single fight.<BR>
And, as a lion- when he spies from far<BR>
A bull that seems to meditate the war,<BR>

His son adjures you by those holy rites,<BR>
That hospitable board, those genial nights;<BR>
Assist my great attempt to gain this prize,<BR>
And let proud Turnus view, with dying eyes,<BR>
His ravish'd spoils." 'T was heard, the vain request;<BR>
Alcides mourn'd, and stifled sighs within his breast.<BR>
Then Jove, to soothe his sorrow, thus began:<BR>
"Short bounds of life are set to mortal man.<BR>
'T is virtue's work alone to stretch the narrow span.<BR>
So many sons of gods, in bloody fight,<BR>
Around the walls of Troy, have lost the light:<BR>
My own Sarpedon fell beneath his foe;<BR>
Nor I, his mighty sire, could ward the blow.<BR>

The spear kept on the fatal course, unstay'd<BR>
By plates of ir'n, which o'er the shield were laid:<BR>
Thro' folded brass and tough bull hides it pass'd,<BR>

If I survive, will Troy the less prevail?<BR>
A single soul's too light to turn the scale."<BR>

"Thy bars and ingots, and the sums beside,<BR>
Leave for thy children's lot. Thy Turnus broke<BR>
All rules of war by one relentless stroke,<BR>

Unus'd to threats, and more unus'd to fear.<BR>
Then Liger thus: "Thy confidence is vain<BR>
To scape from hence, as from the Trojan plain:<BR>
Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode,<BR>
Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode;<BR>
Nor Venus' veil is here, near Neptune's shield;<BR>

As Lucagus, to lash his horses, bends,<BR>
Prone to the wheels, and his left foot protends,<BR>
Prepar'd for fight; the fatal dart arrives,<BR>
And thro' the borders of his buckler drives;<BR>
Pass'd thro' and pierc'd his groin: the deadly wound,<BR>
Cast from his chariot, roll'd him on the ground.<BR>

How fierce in fight, with courage undecay'd!<BR>
Judge if such warriors want immortal aid."<BR>
To whom the goddess with the charming eyes,<BR>
Soft in her tone, submissively replies:<BR>
"Why, O my sov'reign lord, whose frown I fear,<BR>

Why urge you thus my grief? when, if I still<BR>

And glut the Trojans with his pious blood.<BR>
Yet from our lineage he derives his name,<BR>

But, if some secret meaning lies beneath,<BR>
To save the short-liv'd youth from destin'd death,<BR>
Or if a farther thought you entertain,<BR>
To change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain."<BR>
To whom the goddess thus, with weeping eyes:<BR>
"And what if that request, your tongue denies,<BR>
Your heart should grant; and not a short reprieve,<BR>
But length of certain life, to Turnus give?<BR>
Now speedy death attends the guiltless youth,<BR>

Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain.<BR>
Of air condens'd a specter soon she made;<BR>

The fated land you sought so long by sea."<BR>

By chance a ship was fasten'd to the shore,<BR>
Which from old Clusium King Osinius bore:<BR>
The plank was ready laid for safe ascent;<BR>
For shelter there the trembling shadow bent,<BR>
And skipp't and skulk'd, and under hatches went.<BR>
Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste,<BR>
Ascends the plank, and to the galley pass'd.<BR>
Scarce had he reach'd the prow: Saturnia's hand<BR>
The haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land.<BR>

With sense of honor stung, and forfeit fame,<BR>
Fearful besides of what in fight had pass'd,<BR>

Whence am I forc'd, and whether am I borne?<BR>
How, and with what reproach, shall I return?<BR>

What will they say of their deserting chief<BR>
The war was mine: I fly from their relief;<BR>
I led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave;<BR>
And ev'n from hence their dying groans receive.<BR>
Here, overmatch'd in fight, in heaps they lie;<BR>
There, scatter'd o'er the fields, ignobly fly.<BR>
Gape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive!<BR>

And, as a savage boar, on mountains bred,<BR>
With forest mast and fatt'ning marshes fed,<BR>
When once he sees himself in toils inclos'd,<BR>
By huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos'd-<BR>
He whets his tusks, and turns, and dares the war;<BR>
Th' invaders dart their jav'lins from afar:<BR>
All keep aloof, and safely shout around;<BR>
But none presumes to give a nearer wound:<BR>
He frets and froths, erects his bristled hide,<BR>
And shakes a grove of lances from his side:<BR>
Not otherwise the troops, with hate inspir'd,<BR>
And just revenge against the tyrant fir'd,<BR>
Their darts with clamor at a distance drive,<BR>

From Coritus came Acron to the fight,<BR>
Who left his spouse betroth'd, and unconsummate night.<BR>
Mezentius sees him thro' the squadrons ride,<BR>
Proud of the purple favors of his bride.<BR>
Then, as a hungry lion, who beholds<BR>
A gamesome goat, who frisks about the folds,<BR>
Or beamy stag, that grazes on the plain-<BR>
He runs, he roars, he shakes his rising mane,<BR>
He grins, and opens wide his greedy jaws;<BR>
The prey lies panting underneath his paws:<BR>
He fills his famish'd maw; his mouth runs o'er<BR>
With unchew'd morsels, while he churns the gore:<BR>
So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes,<BR>
And first unhappy Acron overthrows:<BR>
Stretch'd at his length, he spurns the swarthy ground;<BR>
The lance, besmear'd with blood, lies broken in the wound.<BR>
Then with disdain the haughty victor view'd<BR>
Orodes flying, nor the wretch pursued,<BR>
Nor thought the dastard's back deserv'd a wound,<BR>
But, running, gain'd th' advantage of the ground:<BR>
Then turning short, he met him face to face,<BR>
To give his victor the better grace.<BR>
Orodes falls, in equal fight oppress'd:<BR>
Mezentius fix'd his foot upon his breast,<BR>
And rested lance; and thus aloud he cries:<BR>
"Lo! here the champion of my rebels lies!"<BR>
The fields around with Io Paean! ring;<BR>
And peals of shouts applaud the conqu'ring king.<BR>
At this the vanquish'd, with his dying breath,<BR>
Thus faintly spoke, and prophesied in death:<BR>
"Nor thou, proud man, unpunish'd shalt remain:<BR>
Like death attends thee on this fatal plain."<BR>
Then, sourly smiling, thus the king replied:<BR>
"For what belongs to me, let Jove provide;<BR>
But die thou first, whatever chance ensue."<BR>
He said, and from the wound the weapon drew.<BR>
A hov'ring mist came swimming o'er his sight,<BR>
And seal'd his eyes in everlasting night.<BR>

Who from Lycaon's blood his lineage drew.<BR>

Who threw his master, as he made a bound:<BR>

Once more the proud Mezentius, with disdain,<BR>

The Trojan prince beheld him from afar,<BR>
And dauntless undertook the doubtful war.<BR>
Collected in his strength, and like a rock,<BR>
Pois'd on his base, Mezentius stood the shock.<BR>
He stood, and, measuring first with careful eyes<BR>
The space his spear could reach, aloud he cries:<BR>
"My strong right hand, and sword, assist my stroke!<BR>
(Those only gods Mezentius will invoke.)<BR>
His armor, from the Trojan pirate torn,<BR>
By my triumphant Lausus shall be worn."<BR>
He said; and with his utmost force he threw<BR>
The massy spear, which, hissing as it flew,<BR>
Reach'd the celestial shield, that stopp'd the course;<BR>
But, glancing thence, the yet unbroken force<BR>
Took a new bent obliquely, and betwixt<BR>
The side and bowels fam'd Anthores fix'd.<BR>
Anthores had from Argos travel'd far,<BR>
Alcides' friend, and brother of the war;<BR>
Till, tir'd with toils, fair Italy he chose,<BR>
And in Evander's palace sought repose.<BR>
Now, falling by another's wound, his eyes<BR>
He cast to heav'n, on Argos thinks, and dies.<BR>

The pious Trojan then his jav'lin sent;<BR>

Transpierc'd his thigh, and spent its dying force.<BR>
The gaping wound gush'd out a crimson flood.<BR>
The Trojan, glad with sight of hostile blood,<BR>
His faunchion drew, to closer fight address'd,<BR>
And with new force his fainting foe oppress'd.<BR>

Pain'd with his wound, and useless for the fight,<BR>

Incumber'd, slow he dragg'd the spear along,<BR>

Aeneas thus, o'erwhelmed on ev'ry side,<BR>

In rash attempts, beyond thy tender age,<BR>
Betray'd by pious love?" Nor, thus forborne,<BR>
The youth desists, but with insulting scorn<BR>

Gave place; and all his breast with fury fir'd.<BR>
For now the Fates prepar'd their sharpen'd shears;<BR>

But when, with blood and paleness all o'erspread,<BR>
The pious prince beheld young Lausus dead,<BR>

Then stretch'd his hand to hold him up, and said:<BR>
"Poor hapless youth! what praises can be paid<BR>
To love so great, to such transcendent store<BR>
Of early worth, and sure presage of more?<BR>
Accept whate'er Aeneas can afford;<BR>
Untouch'd thy arms, untaken be thy sword;<BR>
And all that pleas'd thee living, still remain<BR>
Inviolate, and sacred to the slain.<BR>
Thy body on thy parents I bestow,<BR>
To rest thy soul, at least, if shadows know,<BR>
Or have a sense of human things below.<BR>
There to thy fellow ghosts with glory tell:<BR>
''T was by the great Aeneas hand I fell.'"<BR>
With this, his distant friends he beckons near,<BR>
Provokes their duty, and prevents their fear:<BR>

With clotted locks, and blood that well'd from out the wound.<BR>

Meantime, his father, now no father, stood,<BR>
And wash'd his wounds by Tiber's yellow flood:<BR>
Oppress'd with anguish, panting, and o'erspent,<BR>
His fainting limbs against an oak he leant.<BR>
A bough his brazen helmet did sustain;<BR>
His heavier arms lay scatter'd on the plain:<BR>
A chosen train of youth around him stand;<BR>
His drooping head was rested on his hand:<BR>
His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought;<BR>
And all on Lausus ran his restless thought.<BR>
Careful, concern'd his danger to prevent,<BR>
He much enquir'd, and many a message sent<BR>
To warn him from the field- alas! in vain!<BR>
Behold, his mournful followers bear him slain!<BR>
O'er his broad shield still gush'd the yawning wound,<BR>
And drew a bloody trail along the ground.<BR>
Far off he heard their cries, far off divin'd<BR>
The dire event, with a foreboding mind.<BR>
With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head;<BR>
Then both his lifted hands to heav'n he spread;<BR>
Last, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said:<BR>
"What joys, alas! could this frail being give,<BR>
That I have been so covetous to live?<BR>
To see my son, and such a son, resign<BR>
His life, a ransom for preserving mine!<BR>
And am I then preserv'd, and art thou lost?<BR>
How much too dear has that redemption cost!<BR>
'T is now my bitter banishment I feel:<BR>
This is a wound too deep for time to heal.<BR>
My guilt thy growing virtues did defame;<BR>
My blackness blotted thy unblemish'd name.<BR>
Chas'd from a throne, abandon'd, and exil'd<BR>
For foul misdeeds, were punishments too mild:<BR>
I ow'd my people these, and, from their hate,<BR>
With less resentment could have borne my fate.<BR>
And yet I live, and yet sustain the sight<BR>
Of hated men, and of more hated light:<BR>
But will not long." With that he rais'd from ground<BR>
His fainting limbs, that stagger'd with his wound;<BR>
Yet, with a mind resolv'd, and unappall'd<BR>
With pains or perils, for his courser call'd<BR>
Well-mouth'd, well-manag'd, whom himself did dress<BR>
With daily care, and mounted with success;<BR>
His aid in arms, his ornament in peace.<BR>

Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke,<BR>
The steed seem'd sensible, while thus he spoke:<BR>

If life and long were terms that could agree!<BR>
This day thou either shalt bring back the head<BR>
And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead;<BR>
This day thou either shalt revenge my woe,<BR>
For murther'd Lausus, on his cruel foe;<BR>
Or, if inexorable fate deny<BR>
Our conquest, with thy conquer'd master die:<BR>
For, after such a lord, I rest secure,<BR>
Thou wilt no foreign reins, or Trojan load endure."<BR>
He said; and straight th' officious courser kneels,<BR>
To take his wonted weight. His hands he fills<BR>
With pointed jav'lins; on his head he lac'd<BR>
His glitt'ring helm, which terribly was grac'd<BR>
With waving horsehair, nodding from afar;<BR>
Then spurr'd his thund'ring steed amidst the war.<BR>
Love, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought,<BR>
Despair, and secret shame, and conscious thought<BR>
Of inborn worth, his lab'ring soul oppress'd,<BR>
Roll'd in his eyes, and rag'd within his breast.<BR>
Then loud he call'd Aeneas thrice by name:<BR>
The loud repeated voice to glad Aeneas came.<BR>
"Great Jove," he said, "and the far-shooting god,<BR>
Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good!"<BR>
He spoke no more; but hasten'd, void of fear,<BR>

Forbear thy threats: my bus'ness is to die;<BR>
But first receive this parting legacy."<BR>
He said; and straight a whirling dart he sent;<BR>
Another after, and another went.<BR>
Round in a spacious ring he rides the field,<BR>
And vainly plies th' impenetrable shield.<BR>
Thrice rode he round; and thrice Aeneas wheel'd,<BR>
Turn'd as he turn'd: the golden orb withstood<BR>
The strokes, and bore about an iron wood.<BR>
Impatient of delay, and weary grown,<BR>
Still to defend, and to defend alone,<BR>
To wrench the darts which in his buckler light,<BR>
Urg'd and o'er-labor'd in unequal fight;<BR>
At length resolv'd, he throws with all his force<BR>
Full at the temples of the warrior horse.<BR>
Just where the stroke was aim'd, th' unerring spear<BR>
Made way, and stood transfix'd thro' either ear.<BR>
Seiz'd with unwonted pain, surpris'd with fright,<BR>
The wounded steed curvets, and, rais'd upright,<BR>
Lights on his feet before; his hoofs behind<BR>
Spring up in air aloft, and lash the wind.<BR>

Struggling, and wildly staring on the skies,<BR>

Nor ask I life, nor fought with that design:<BR>
As I had us'd my fortune, use thou thine.<BR>

The gift is hateful from his murd'rer's hand.<BR>
For this, this only favor let me sue,<BR>
If pity can to conquer'd foes be due:<BR>
Refuse it not; but let my body have<BR>
The last retreat of humankind, a grave.<BR>
Too well I know th' insulting people's hate;<BR>
Protect me from their vengeance after fate:<BR>
This refuge for my poor remains provide,<BR>
And lay my much-lov'd Lausus by my side."<BR>

The crimson stream distain'd his arms around,<BR>

Embrac'd me, parting for th' Etrurian land,<BR>
And sent me to possess a large command.<BR>

And now perhaps, in hopes of thy return,<BR>
Rich odors on his loaded altars burn,<BR>
While we, with vain officious pomp, prepare<BR>
To send him back his portion of the war,<BR>
A bloody breathless body, which can owe<BR>
No farther debt, but to the pow'rs below.<BR>
The wretched father, ere his race is run,<BR>
Shall view the fun'ral honors of his son.<BR>
These are my triumphs of the Latian war,<BR>

And seek alliance in some other land:<BR>
Build you the city which your fates assign;<BR>
We shall be proud in the great work to join."<BR>

Thus Drances; and his words so well persuade<BR>
The rest impower'd, that soon a truce is made.<BR>
Twelve days the term allow'd: and, during those,<BR>
Latians and Trojans, now no longer foes,<BR>
Mix'd in the woods, for fun'ral piles prepare<BR>
To fell the timber, and forget the war.<BR>
Loud axes thro' the groaning groves resound;<BR>
Oak, mountain ash, and poplar spread the ground;<BR>
First fall from high; and some the trunks receive<BR>
In loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave.<BR>

And now the fatal news by Fame is blown<BR>
Thro' the short circuit of th' Arcadian town,<BR>
Of Pallas slain- by Fame, which just before<BR>
His triumphs on distended pinions bore.<BR>
Rushing from out the gate, the people stand,<BR>
Each with a fun'ral flambeau in his hand.<BR>
Wildly they stare, distracted with amaze:<BR>
The fields are lighten'd with a fiery blaze,<BR>
That cast a sullen splendor on their friends,<BR>
The marching troop which their dead prince attends.<BR>
Both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry;<BR>
The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply,<BR>
And their mix'd mourning rends the vaulted sky.<BR>
The town is fill'd with tumult and with tears,<BR>
Till the loud clamors reach Evander's ears:<BR>
Forgetful of his state, he runs along,<BR>
With a disorder'd pace, and cleaves the throng;<BR>
Falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies,<BR>
With silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes.<BR>
Short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks<BR>
A passage, and at once he weeps and speaks:<BR>

"O Pallas! thou hast fail'd thy plighted word,<BR>
To fight with caution, not to tempt the sword!<BR>
I warn'd thee, but in vain; for well I knew<BR>
What perils youthful ardor would pursue,<BR>
That boiling blood would carry thee too far,<BR>
Young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war!<BR>
O curst essay of arms, disastrous doom,<BR>
Prelude of bloody fields, and fights to come!<BR>
Hard elements of unauspicious war,<BR>
Vain vows to Heav'n, and unavailing care!<BR>
Thrice happy thou, dear partner of my bed,<BR>
Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled,<BR>
Praescious of ills, and leaving me behind,<BR>
To drink the dregs of life by fate assign'd!<BR>
Beyond the goal of nature I have gone:<BR>
My Pallas late set out, but reach'd too soon.<BR>
If, for my league against th' Ausonian state,<BR>
Amidst their weapons I had found my fate,<BR>
(Deserv'd from them,) then I had been return'd<BR>
A breathless victor, and my son had mourn'd.<BR>
Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid,<BR>
Nor grudge th' alliance I so gladly made.<BR>
'T was not his fault, my Pallas fell so young,<BR>
But my own crime, for having liv'd too long.<BR>
Yet, since the gods had destin'd him to die,<BR>
At least he led the way to victory:<BR>
First for his friends he won the fatal shore,<BR>
And sent whole herds of slaughter'd foes before;<BR>
A death too great, too glorious to deplore.<BR>
Nor will I add new honors to thy grave,<BR>
Content with those the Trojan hero gave:<BR>
That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends design'd,<BR>
In which the Tuscan chiefs and army join'd.<BR>
Great spoils and trophies, gain'd by thee, they bear:<BR>
Then let thy own achievements be thy share.<BR>
Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood,<BR>
Whose mighty trunk had better grac'd the wood,<BR>
If Pallas had arriv'd, with equal length<BR>
Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength.<BR>
But why, unhappy man, dost thou detain<BR>
These troops, to view the tears thou shedd'st in vain?<BR>
Go, friends, this message to your lord relate:<BR>
Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate,<BR>
And, after Pallas' death, live ling'ring on,<BR>
'T is to behold his vengeance for my son.<BR>
I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head<BR>
Is owing to the living and the dead.<BR>
My son and I expect it from his hand;<BR>
'T is all that he can give, or we demand.<BR>
Joy is no more; but I would gladly go,<BR>
To greet my Pallas with such news below."<BR>

The morn had now dispell'd the shades of night,<BR>
Restoring toils, when she restor'd the light.<BR>

Black smold'ring smoke from the green wood expires;<BR>

Then thrice around the kindled piles they go<BR>
(For ancient custom had ordain'd it so)<BR>
Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led;<BR>
And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead.<BR>
Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground,<BR>
And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound.<BR>
Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw<BR>
The spoils, in battle taken from the foe:<BR>
Helms, bits emboss'd, and swords of shining steel;<BR>
One casts a target, one a chariot wheel;<BR>
Some to their fellows their own arms restore:<BR>
The fauchions which in luckless fight they bore,<BR>
Their bucklers pierc'd, their darts bestow'd in vain,<BR>
And shiver'd lances gather'd from the plain.<BR>
Whole herds of offer'd bulls, about the fire,<BR>
And bristled boars, and woolly sheep expire.<BR>
Around the piles a careful troop attends,<BR>
To watch the wasting flames, and weep their burning friends;<BR>
Ling'ring along the shore, till dewy night<BR>
New decks the face of heav'n with starry light.<BR>

Borne off in state, are buried in the town;<BR>
The rest, unhonor'd, and without a name,<BR>
Are cast a common heap to feed the flame.<BR>

To make the field of battle shine with fires,<BR>

These relics with their country rites they grace,<BR>

But, in the palace of the king, appears<BR>
A scene more solemn, and a pomp of tears.<BR>

All in that universal sorrow share,<BR>
And curse the cause of this unhappy war:<BR>
A broken league, a bride unjustly sought,<BR>
A crown usurp'd, which with their blood is bought!<BR>
These are the crimes with which they load the name<BR>
Of Turnus, and on him alone exclaim:<BR>
"Let him who lords it o'er th' Ausonian land<BR>

"His foe expects, and dares him to the fight."<BR>

When Venulus began, the murmuring sound<BR>
Was hush'd, and sacred silence reign'd around.<BR>

We reach'd the place desir'd; with wonder fill'd,<BR>
The Grecian tents and rising tow'rs beheld.<BR>
Great Diomede has compass'd round with walls<BR>
The city, which Argyripa he calls,<BR>
From his own Argos nam'd. We touch'd, with joy,<BR>
The royal hand that raz'd unhappy Troy.<BR>
When introduc'd, our presents first we bring,<BR>
Then crave an instant audience from the king.<BR>
His leave obtain'd, our native soil we name,<BR>
And tell th' important cause for which we came.<BR>
Attentively he heard us, while we spoke;<BR>
Then, with soft accents, and a pleasing look,<BR>
Made this return: 'Ausonian race, of old<BR>
Renown'd for peace, and for an age of gold,<BR>
What madness has your alter'd minds possess'd,<BR>
To change for war hereditary rest,<BR>
Solicit arms unknown, and tempt the sword,<BR>
A needless ill your ancestors abhorr'd?<BR>
We- for myself I speak, and all the name<BR>
Of Grecians, who to Troy's destruction came,<BR>
Omitting those who were in battle slain,<BR>
Or borne by rolling Simois to the main-<BR>
Not one but suffer'd, and too dearly bought<BR>
The prize of honor which in arms he sought;<BR>
Some doom'd to death, and some in exile driv'n.<BR>
Outcasts, abandon'd by the care of Heav'n;<BR>
So worn, so wretched, so despis'd a crew,<BR>
As ev'n old Priam might with pity view.<BR>
Witness the vessels by Minerva toss'd<BR>
In storms; the vengeful Capharean coast;<BR>
Th' Euboean rocks! the prince, whose brother led<BR>
Our armies to revenge his injur'd bed,<BR>
In Egypt lost! Ulysses with his men<BR>
Have seen Charybdis and the Cyclops' den.<BR>
Why should I name Idomeneus, in vain<BR>
Restor'd to scepters, and expell'd again?<BR>
Or young Achilles, by his rival slain?<BR>
Ev'n he, the King of Men, the foremost name<BR>
Of all the Greeks, and most renown'd by fame,<BR>
The proud revenger of another's wife,<BR>
Yet by his own adult'ress lost his life;<BR>
Fell at his threshold; and the spoils of Troy<BR>
The foul polluters of his bed enjoy.<BR>
The gods have envied me the sweets of life,<BR>
My much lov'd country, and my more lov'd wife:<BR>
Banish'd from both, I mourn; while in the sky,<BR>
Transform'd to birds, my lost companions fly:<BR>
Hov'ring about the coasts, they make their moan,<BR>
And cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own.<BR>
What squalid specters, in the dead of night,<BR>
Break my short sleep, and skim before my sight!<BR>
I might have promis'd to myself those harms,<BR>
Mad as I was, when I, with mortal arms,<BR>
Presum'd against immortal pow'rs to move,<BR>
And violate with wounds the Queen of Love.<BR>
Such arms this hand shall never more employ;<BR>
No hate remains with me to ruin'd Troy.<BR>
I war not with its dust; nor am I glad<BR>
To think of past events, or good or bad.<BR>
Your presents I return: whate'er you bring<BR>
To buy my friendship, send the Trojan king.<BR>
We met in fight; I know him, to my cost:<BR>
With what a whirling force his lance he toss'd!<BR>
Heav'ns! what a spring was in his arm, to throw!<BR>
How high he held his shield, and rose at ev'ry blow!<BR>
Had Troy produc'd two more his match in might,<BR>
They would have chang'd the fortune of the fight:<BR>
Th' invasion of the Greeks had been return'd,<BR>
Our empire wasted, and our cities burn'd.<BR>
The long defense the Trojan people made,<BR>
The war protracted, and the siege delay'd,<BR>
Were due to Hector's and this hero's hand:<BR>
Both brave alike, and equal in command;<BR>
Aeneas, not inferior in the field,<BR>
In pious reverence to the gods excell'd.<BR>
Make peace, ye Latians, and avoid with care<BR>

Thus Venulus concluded his report.<BR>
A jarring murmur fill'd the factious court:<BR>

Roars horrible along th' uneasy race;<BR>
White foam in gath'ring eddies floats around;<BR>
The rocky shores rebellow to the sound.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The murmur ceas'd: then from his lofty throne<BR>
The king invok'd the gods, and thus begun:<BR>
"I wish, ye Latins, what we now debate<BR>
Had been resolv'd before it was too late.<BR>
Much better had it been for you and me,<BR>
Unforc'd by this our last necessity,<BR>
To have been earlier wise, than now to call<BR>
A council, when the foe surrounds the wall.<BR>
O citizens, we wage unequal war,<BR>
With men not only Heav'n's peculiar care,<BR>
But Heav'n's own race; unconquer'd in the field,<BR>
Or, conquer'd, yet unknowing how to yield.<BR>
What hopes you had in Diomedes, lay down:<BR>
Our hopes must center on ourselves alone.<BR>
Yet those how feeble, and, indeed, how vain,<BR>
You see too well; nor need my words explain.<BR>
Vanquish'd without resource; laid flat by fate;<BR>
Factions within, a foe without the gate!<BR>
Not but I grant that all perform'd their parts<BR>
With manly force, and with undaunted hearts:<BR>
With our united strength the war we wag'd;<BR>
With equal numbers, equal arms, engag'd.<BR>
You see th' event.- Now hear what I propose,<BR>
To save our friends, and satisfy our foes.<BR>
A tract of land the Latins have possess'd<BR>
Along the Tiber, stretching to the west,<BR>
Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till,<BR>
And their mix'd cattle graze the fruitful hill.<BR>
Those mountains fill'd with firs, that lower land,<BR>
If you consent, the Trojan shall command,<BR>
Call'd into part of what is ours; and there,<BR>
On terms agreed, the common country share.<BR>
There let'em build and settle, if they please;<BR>
Unless they choose once more to cross the seas,<BR>
In search of seats remote from Italy,<BR>
And from unwelcome inmates set us free.<BR>
Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed,<BR>
Or twice as many more, if more they need.<BR>
Materials are at hand; a well-grown wood<BR>
Runs equal with the margin of the flood:<BR>
Let them the number and the form assign;<BR>
The care and cost of all the stores be mine.<BR>
To treat the peace, a hundred senators<BR>
Shall be commission'd hence with ample pow'rs,<BR>
With olive the presents they shall bear,<BR>
A purple robe, a royal iv'ry chair,<BR>
And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear,<BR>
And sums of gold. Among yourselves debate<BR>
This great affair, and save the sinking state."<BR>

Then Drances took the word, who grudg'd, long since,<BR>
The rising glories of the Daunian prince.<BR>
Factious and rich, bold at the council board,<BR>
But cautious in the field, he shunn'd the sword;<BR>
A close caballer, and tongue-valiant lord.<BR>
Noble his mother was, and near the throne;<BR>
But, what his father's parentage, unknown.<BR>
He rose, and took th' advantage of the times,<BR>

Whose pride this unauspicious war began;<BR>
For whose ambition (let me dare to say,<BR>
Fear set apart, tho' death is in my way)<BR>
The plains of Latium run with blood around.<BR>
So many valiant heroes bite the ground;<BR>
Dejected grief in ev'ry face appears;<BR>
A town in mourning, and a land in tears;<BR>
While he, th' undoubted author of our harms,<BR>
The man who menaces the gods with arms,<BR>
Yet, after all his boasts, forsook the fight,<BR>
And sought his safety in ignoble flight.<BR>
Now, best of kings, since you propose to send<BR>
Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend;<BR>
Add yet a greater at our joint request,<BR>
One which he values more than all the rest:<BR>
Give him the fair Lavinia for his bride;<BR>
With that alliance let the league be tied,<BR>
And for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide.<BR>
Let insolence no longer awe the throne;<BR>
But, with a father's right, bestow your own.<BR>
For this maligner of the general good,<BR>
If still we fear his force, he must be woo'd;<BR>
His haughty godhead we with pray'rs implore,<BR>
Your scepter to release, and our just rights restore.<BR>
O cursed cause of all our ills, must we<BR>
Wage wars unjust, and fall in fight, for thee!<BR>
What right hast thou to rule the Latian state,<BR>
And send us out to meet our certain fate?<BR>
'T is a destructive war: from Turnus' hand<BR>
Our peace and public safety we demand.<BR>
Let the fair bride to the brave chief remain;<BR>
If not, the peace, without the pledge, is vain.<BR>
Turnus, I know you think me not your friend,<BR>
Nor will I much with your belief contend:<BR>
I beg your greatness not to give the law<BR>
In others' realms, but, beaten, to withdraw.<BR>
Pity your own, or pity our estate;<BR>
Nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate.<BR>
Your interest is, the war should never cease;<BR>
But we have felt enough to wish the peace:<BR>
A land exhausted to the last remains,<BR>
Depopulated towns, and driven plains.<BR>
Yet, if desire of fame, and thirst of pow'r,<BR>
A beauteous princess, with a crown in dow'r,<BR>
So fire your mind, in arms assert your right,<BR>
And meet your foe, who dares you to the fight.<BR>
Mankind, it seems, is made for you alone;<BR>
We, but the slaves who mount you to the throne:<BR>
A base ignoble crowd, without a name,<BR>
Unwept, unworthy, of the fun'ral flame,<BR>
By duty bound to forfeit each his life,<BR>
That Turnus may possess a royal wife.<BR>
Permit not, mighty man, so mean a crew<BR>
Should share such triumphs, and detain from you<BR>
The post of honor, your undoubted due.<BR>
Rather alone your matchless force employ,<BR>
To merit what alone you must enjoy."<BR>

These words, so full of malice mix'd with art,<BR>
Inflam'd with rage the youthful hero's heart.<BR>

If any doubt remains, who dares the most,<BR>

And issue both abreast, where honor calls-<BR>
Foes are not far to seek without the walls-<BR>
Unless his noisy tongue can only fight,<BR>
And feet were giv'n him but to speed his flight.<BR>

Who, but so known a dastard, dares to say?<BR>

What heaps of Trojans by this hand were slain,<BR>
And how the bloody Tiber swell'd the main.<BR>
All saw, but he, th' Arcadian troops retire<BR>
In scatter'd squadrons, and their prince expire.<BR>
The giant brothers, in their camp, have found,<BR>
I was not forc'd with ease to quit my ground.<BR>
Not such the Trojans tried me, when, inclos'd,<BR>
I singly their united arms oppos'd:<BR>
First forc'd an entrance thro' their thick array;<BR>
Then, glutted with their slaughter, freed my way.<BR>
'T is a destructive war? So let it be,<BR>

Meantime proceed to fill the people's ears<BR>
With false reports, their minds with panic fears:<BR>
Extol the strength of a twice-conquer'd race;<BR>
Our foes encourage, and our friends debase.<BR>
Believe thy fables, and the Trojan town<BR>
Triumphant stands; the Grecians are o'erthrown;<BR>
Suppliant at Hector's feet Achilles lies,<BR>
And Diomede from fierce Aeneas flies.<BR>
Say rapid Aufidus with awful dread<BR>
Runs backward from the sea, and hides his head,<BR>
When the great Trojan on his bank appears;<BR>
For that's as true as thy dissembled fears<BR>
Of my revenge. Dismiss that vanity:<BR>

Runs a distracted crew, whom their last labor calls.<BR>
A sad procession in the streets is seen,<BR>
Of matrons, that attend the mother queen:<BR>
High in her chair she sits, and, at her side,<BR>
With downcast eyes, appears the fatal bride.<BR>
They mount the cliff, where Pallas' temple stands;<BR>
Pray'rs in their mouths, and presents in their hands,<BR>
With censers first they fume the sacred shrine,<BR>
Then in this common supplication join:<BR>
"O patroness of arms, unspotted maid,<BR>
Propitious hear, and lend thy Latins aid!<BR>
Break short the pirate's lance; pronounce his fate,<BR>
And lay the Phrygian low before the gate."<BR>

Now Turnus arms for fight. His back and breast<BR>
Well-temper'd steel and scaly brass invest:<BR>
The cuishes which his brawny thighs infold<BR>
Are mingled metal damask'd o'er with gold.<BR>
His faithful fauchion sits upon his side;<BR>
Nor casque, nor crest, his manly features hide:<BR>
But, bare to view, amid surrounding friends,<BR>
With godlike grace, he from the tow'r descends.<BR>
Exulting in his strength, he seems to dare<BR>
His absent rival, and to promise war.<BR>
Freed from his keepers, thus, with broken reins,<BR>
The wanton courser prances o'er the plains,<BR>
Or in the pride of youth o'erleaps the mounds,<BR>
And snuffs the females in forbidden grounds.<BR>
Or seeks his wat'ring in the well-known flood,<BR>
To quench his thirst, and cool his fiery blood:<BR>
He swims luxuriant in the liquid plain,<BR>
And o'er his shoulder flows his waving mane:<BR>
He neighs, he snorts, he bears his head on high;<BR>
Before his ample chest the frothy waters fly.<BR>

Whose common suit Camilla thus commends:<BR>
"If sense of honor, if a soul secure<BR>

Can promise aught, or on itself rely<BR>
Greatly to dare, to conquer or to die;<BR>

Turnus a while stood mute, with glad surprise,<BR>
And on the fierce virago fix'd his eyes;<BR>

Not only words lie lab'ring in my breast,<BR>
But thought itself is by thy praise oppress'd.<BR>
Yet rob me not of all; but let me join<BR>
My toils, my hazard, and my fame, with thine.<BR>
The Trojan, not in stratagem unskill'd,<BR>
Sends his light horse before to scour the field:<BR>
Himself, thro' steep ascents and thorny brakes,<BR>
A larger compass to the city takes.<BR>
This news my scouts confirm, and I prepare<BR>
To foil his cunning, and his force to dare;<BR>
With chosen foot his passage to forelay,<BR>
And place an ambush in the winding way.<BR>
Thou, with thy Volscians, face the Tuscan horse;<BR>
The brave Messapus shall thy troops inforce<BR>
With those of Tibur, and the Latian band,<BR>
Subjected all to thy supreme command."<BR>
This said, he warns Messapus to the war,<BR>

Inclos'd with hills, a winding valley lies,<BR>
By nature form'd for fraud, and fitted for surprise.<BR>
A narrow track, by human steps untrode,<BR>
Leads, thro' perplexing thorns, to this obscure abode.<BR>
High o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands,<BR>
Whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands.<BR>
The top is level, an offensive seat<BR>
Of war; and from the war a safe retreat:<BR>
For, on the right and left, is room to press<BR>
The foes at hand, or from afar distress;<BR>
To drive 'em headlong downward, and to pour<BR>
On their descending backs a stony show'r.<BR>

Possess'd the pass, and in blind ambush lay.<BR>

Meantime Latonian Phoebe, from the skies,<BR>
Beheld th' approaching war with hateful eyes,<BR>
And call'd the light-foot Opis to her aid,<BR>
Her most belov'd and ever-trusty maid;<BR>

To meet her death amidst her fatal foes:<BR>
The nymphs I lov'd of all my mortal train,<BR>
Invested with Diana's arms, in vain.<BR>
Nor is my kindness for the virgin new:<BR>
'T was born with her; and with her years it grew.<BR>
Her father Metabus, when forc'd away<BR>
From old Privernum, for tyrannic sway,<BR>
Snatch'd up, and sav'd from his prevailing foes,<BR>
This tender babe, companion of his woes.<BR>
Casmilla was her mother; but he drown'd<BR>
One hissing letter in a softer sound,<BR>
And call'd Camilla. Thro' the woods he flies;<BR>
Wrapp'd in his robe the royal infant lies.<BR>
His foes in sight, he mends his weary pace;<BR>
With shout and clamors they pursue the chase.<BR>
The banks of Amasene at length he gains:<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The raging flood his farther flight restrains,<BR>
Rais'd o'er the borders with unusual rains.<BR>
Prepar'd to plunge into the stream, he fears,<BR>
Not for himself, but for the charge he bears.<BR>
Anxious, he stops a while, and thinks in haste;<BR>
Then, desp'rate in distress, resolves at last.<BR>
A knotty lance of well-boil'd oak he bore;<BR>
The middle part with cork he cover'd o'er:<BR>
He clos'd the child within the hollow space;<BR>
With twigs of bending osier bound the case;<BR>
Then pois'd the spear, heavy with human weight,<BR>
And thus invok'd my favor for the freight:<BR>
'Accept, great goddess of the woods,' he said,<BR>
'Sent by her sire, this dedicated maid!<BR>
Thro' air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine;<BR>
And the first weapons that she knows, are thine.'<BR>
He said; and with full force the spear he threw:<BR>
Above the sounding waves Camilla flew.<BR>
Then, press'd by foes, he stemm'd the stormy tide,<BR>
And gain'd, by stress of arms, the farther side.<BR>
His fasten'd spear he pull'd from out the ground,<BR>
And, victor of his vows, his infant nymph unbound;<BR>
Nor, after that, in towns which walls inclose,<BR>
Would trust his hunted life amidst his foes;<BR>
But, rough, in open air he chose to lie;<BR>
Earth was his couch, his cov'ring was the sky.<BR>
On hills unshorn, or in a desart den,<BR>
He shunn'd the dire society of men.<BR>
A shepherd's solitary life he led;<BR>
His daughter with the milk of mares he fed.<BR>
The dugs of bears, and ev'ry salvage beast,<BR>
He drew, and thro' her lips the liquor press'd.<BR>
The little Amazon could scarcely go:<BR>
He loads her with a quiver and a bow;<BR>
And, that she might her stagg'ring steps command,<BR>
He with a slender jav'lin fills her hand.<BR>
Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound;<BR>
Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground.<BR>
Instead of these, a tiger's hide o'erspread<BR>
Her back and shoulders, fasten'd to her head.<BR>
The flying dart she first attempts to fling,<BR>
And round her tender temples toss'd the sling;<BR>
Then, as her strength with years increas'd, began<BR>
To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan,<BR>
And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane.<BR>
The Tuscan matrons with each other vied,<BR>
To bless their rival sons with such a bride;<BR>
But she disdains their love, to share with me<BR>
The sylvan shades and vow'd virginity.<BR>
And, O! I wish, contented with my cares<BR>
Of salvage spoils, she had not sought the wars!<BR>
Then had she been of my celestial train,<BR>
And shunn'd the fate that dooms her to be slain.<BR>
But since, opposing Heav'n's decree, she goes<BR>
To find her death among forbidden foes,<BR>
Haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight.<BR>
Where, with the gods, averse, the Latins fight.<BR>
This bow to thee, this quiver I bequeath,<BR>
This chosen arrow, to revenge her death:<BR>
By whate'er hand Camilla shall be slain,<BR>
Or of the Trojan or Italian train,<BR>
Let him not pass unpunish'd from the plain.<BR>
Then, in a hollow cloud, myself will aid<BR>
To bear the breathless body of my maid:<BR>
Unspoil'd shall be her arms, and unprofan'd<BR>
Her holy limbs with any human hand,<BR>
And in a marble tomb laid in her native land."<BR>

Shields, arms, and spears flash horribly from far;<BR>
And the fields glitter with a waving war.<BR>
Oppos'd to these, come on with furious force<BR>
Messapus, Coras, and the Latian horse;<BR>
These in the body plac'd, on either hand<BR>
Sustain'd and clos'd by fair Camilla's band.<BR>
Advancing in a line, they couch their spears;<BR>

Thick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are seen<BR>

In distance of their darts they stop their course;<BR>
Then man to man they rush, and horse to horse.<BR>
The face of heav'n their flying jav'lins hide,<BR>

Tyrrhenus, and Aconteus, void of fear,<BR>
By mettled coursers borne in full career,<BR>
Meet first oppos'd; and, with a mighty shock,<BR>
Their horses' heads against each other knock.<BR>
Far from his steed is fierce Aconteus cast,<BR>
As with an engine's force, or lightning's blast:<BR>
He rolls along in blood, and breathes his last.<BR>
The Latin squadrons take a sudden fright,<BR>
And sling their shields behind, to save their backs in flight<BR>
Spurring at speed to their own walls they drew;<BR>
Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue,<BR>
And urge their flight: Asylas leads the chase;<BR>
Till, seiz'd, with shame, they wheel about and face,<BR>
Receive their foes, and raise a threat'ning cry.<BR>
The Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly.<BR>
So swelling surges, with a thund'ring roar,<BR>
Driv'n on each other's backs, insult the shore,<BR>
Bound o'er the rocks, incroach upon the land,<BR>
And far upon the beach eject the sand;<BR>
Then backward, with a swing, they take their way,<BR>
Repuls'd from upper ground, and seek their mother sea;<BR>
With equal hurry quit th' invaded shore,<BR>
And swallow back the sand and stones they spew'd before.<BR>

Twice were the Tuscans masters of the field,<BR>
Twice by the Latins, in their turn, repell'd.<BR>

Both hosts resolv'd, and mingled man to man.<BR>
Now dying groans are heard; the fields are strow'd<BR>
With falling bodies, and are drunk with blood.<BR>
Arms, horses, men, on heaps together lie:<BR>
Confus'd the fight, and more confus'd the cry.<BR>
Orsilochus, who durst not press too near<BR>
Strong Remulus, at distance drove his spear,<BR>
And stuck the steel beneath his horse's ear.<BR>
The fiery steed, impatient of the wound,<BR>
Curvets, and, springing upward with a bound,<BR>
His helpless lord cast backward on the ground.<BR>
Catillus pierc'd Iolas first; then drew<BR>
His reeking lance, and at Herminius threw,<BR>
The mighty champion of the Tuscan crew.<BR>
His neck and throat unarm'd, his head was bare,<BR>
But shaded with a length of yellow hair:<BR>
Secure, he fought, expos'd on ev'ry part,<BR>
A spacious mark for swords, and for the flying dart.<BR>
Across the shoulders came the feather'd wound;<BR>
Transfix'd he fell, and doubled to the ground.<BR>
The sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed,<BR>
And death with honor sought on either side.<BR>

Now with her ax's edge she hews her way:<BR>
Diana's arms upon her shoulder sound;<BR>
And when, too closely press'd, she quits the ground,<BR>
From her bent bow she sends a backward wound.<BR>
Her maids, in martial pomp, on either side,<BR>
Larina, Tulla, fierce Tarpeia, ride:<BR>
Italians all; in peace, their queen's delight;<BR>
In war, the bold companions of the fight.<BR>

Who foremost, and who last, heroic maid,<BR>
On the cold earth were by thy courage laid?<BR>
Thy spear, of mountain ash, Eumenius first,<BR>
With fury driv'n, from side to side transpierc'd:<BR>
A purple stream came spouting from the wound;<BR>
Bath'd in his blood he lies, and bites the ground.<BR>
Liris and Pegasus at once she slew:<BR>
The former, as the slacken'd reins he drew<BR>
Of his faint steed; the latter, as he stretch'd<BR>
His arm to prop his friend, the jav'lin reach'd.<BR>
By the same weapon, sent from the same hand,<BR>
Both fall together, and both spurn the sand.<BR>
Amastrus next is added to the slain:<BR>
The rest in rout she follows o'er the plain:<BR>
Tereus, Harpalycus, Demophoon,<BR>
And Chromis, at full speed her fury shun.<BR>
Of all her deadly darts, not one she lost;<BR>
Each was attended with a Trojan ghost.<BR>
Young Ornithus bestrode a hunter steed,<BR>
Swift for the chase, and of Apulian breed.<BR>
Him from afar she spied, in arms unknown:<BR>
O'er his broad back an ox's hide was thrown;<BR>
His helm a wolf, whose gaping jaws were spread<BR>
A cov'ring for his cheeks, and grinn'd around his head,<BR>
He clench'd within his hand an iron prong,<BR>
And tower'd above the rest, conspicuous in the throng.<BR>
Him soon she singled from the flying train,<BR>
And slew with ease; then thus insults the slain:<BR>
"Vain hunter, didst thou think thro' woods to chase<BR>
The savage herd, a vile and trembling race?<BR>
Here cease thy vaunts, and own my victory:<BR>
A woman warrior was too strong for thee.<BR>
Yet, if the ghosts demand the conqu'ror's name,<BR>
Confessing great Camilla, save thy shame."<BR>
Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew,<BR>
The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew;<BR>
But Butes breast to breast: the spear descends<BR>
Above the gorget, where his helmet ends,<BR>
And o'er the shield which his left side defends.<BR>
Orsilochus and she their courses ply:<BR>
He seems to follow, and she seems to fly;<BR>
But in a narrower ring she makes the race;<BR>
And then he flies, and she pursues the chase.<BR>
Gath'ring at length on her deluded foe,<BR>
She swings her ax, and rises to the blow<BR>
Full on the helm behind, with such a sway<BR>
The weapon falls, the riven steel gives way:<BR>
He groans, he roars, he sues in vain for grace;<BR>
Brains, mingled with his blood, besmear his face.<BR>

Astonish'd Aunus just arrives by chance,<BR>
To see his fall; nor farther dares advance;<BR>
But, fixing on the horrid maid his eye,<BR>
He stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly;<BR>
Yet, like a true Ligurian, born to cheat,<BR>
(At least while fortune favor'd his deceit,)<BR>
Cries out aloud: "What courage have you shown,<BR>
Who trust your courser's strength, and not your own?<BR>
Forego the vantage of your horse, alight,<BR>
And then on equal terms begin the fight:<BR>
It shall be seen, weak woman, what you can,<BR>
When, foot to foot, you combat with a man,"<BR>
He said. She glows with anger and disdain,<BR>
Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain,<BR>
And leaves her horse at large among her train;<BR>
With her drawn sword defies him to the field,<BR>
And, marching, lifts aloft her maiden shield.<BR>
The youth, who thought his cunning did succeed,<BR>
Reins round his horse, and urges all his speed;<BR>
Adds the remembrance of the spur, and hides<BR>
The goring rowels in his bleeding sides.<BR>
"Vain fool, and coward!" cries the lofty maid,<BR>
"Caught in the train which thou thyself hast laid!<BR>
On others practice thy Ligurian arts;<BR>
Thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts<BR>
Are lost on me: nor shalt thou safe retire,<BR>
With vaunting lies, to thy fallacious sire."<BR>
At this, so fast her flying feet she sped,<BR>
That soon she strain'd beyond his horse's head:<BR>
Then turning short, at once she seiz'd the rein,<BR>
And laid the boaster grov'ling on the plain.<BR>
Not with more ease the falcon, from above,<BR>
Trusses in middle air the trembling dove,<BR>
Then plumes the prey, in her strong pounces bound:<BR>
The feathers, foul with blood, come tumbling to the ground.<BR>

Nor less the captive struggles for his life:<BR>
He writhes his body to prolong the strife,<BR>

His utmost vigor, and the point averts.<BR>
So stoops the yellow eagle from on high,<BR>

A king that once in Latium bore the sway.<BR>
The beauteous Opis thither bent her flight,<BR>
To mark the traitor Aruns from the height.<BR>
Him in refulgent arms she soon espied,<BR>
Swoln with success; and loudly thus she cried:<BR>
"Thy backward steps, vain boaster, are too late;<BR>
Turn like a man, at length, and meet thy fate.<BR>
Charg'd with my message, to Camilla go,<BR>

The winged shaft, predestin'd for the deed;<BR>
Then to the stubborn yew her strength applied,<BR>
Till the far distant horns approach'd on either side.<BR>
The bowstring touch'd her breast, so strong she drew;<BR>
Whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew.<BR>
At once the twanging bow and sounding dart<BR>
The traitor heard, and felt the point within his heart.<BR>
Him, beating with his heels in pangs of death,<BR>
His flying friends to foreign fields bequeath.<BR>

Their leader lost, the Volscians quit the field,<BR>
And, unsustain'd, the chiefs of Turnus yield.<BR>
The frighted soldiers, when their captains fly,<BR>

Confus'd in flight, they bear each other down,<BR>
And spur their horses headlong to the town.<BR>
Driv'n by their foes, and to their fears resign'd,<BR>
Not once they turn, but take their wounds behind.<BR>
These drop the shield, and those the lance forego,<BR>
Or on their shoulders bear the slacken'd bow.<BR>
The hoofs of horses, with a rattling sound,<BR>
Beat short and thick, and shake the rotten ground.<BR>
Black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky,<BR>
And o'er the darken'd walls and rampires fly.<BR>
The trembling matrons, from their lofty stands,<BR>
Rend heav'n with female shrieks, and wring their hands.<BR>
All pressing on, pursuers and pursued,<BR>
Are crush'd in crowds, a mingled multitude.<BR>
Some happy few escape: the throng too late<BR>
Rush on for entrance, till they choke the gate.<BR>
Ev'n in the sight of home, the wretched sire<BR>
Looks on, and sees his helpless son expire.<BR>
Then, in a fright, the folding gates they close,<BR>
But leave their friends excluded with their foes.<BR>
The vanquish'd cry; the victors loudly shout;<BR>

Blind in their fear, they bounce against the wall,<BR>

His honor question'd for the promis'd fight;<BR>

To whom the king sedately thus replied:<BR>
"Brave youth, the more your valor has been tried,<BR>
The more becomes it us, with due respect,<BR>
To weigh the chance of war, which you neglect.<BR>
You want not wealth, or a successive throne,<BR>
Or cities which your arms have made your own:<BR>
My towns and treasures are at your command,<BR>
And stor'd with blooming beauties is my land;<BR>
Laurentum more than one Lavinia sees,<BR>
Unmarried, fair, of noble families.<BR>
Now let me speak, and you with patience hear,<BR>
Things which perhaps may grate a lover's ear,<BR>
But sound advice, proceeding from a heart<BR>
Sincerely yours, and free from fraudful art.<BR>
The gods, by signs, have manifestly shown,<BR>
No prince Italian born should heir my throne:<BR>
Oft have our augurs, in prediction skill'd,<BR>
And oft our priests, foreign son reveal'd.<BR>
Yet, won by worth that cannot be withstood,<BR>
Brib'd by my kindness to my kindred blood,<BR>
Urg'd by my wife, who would not be denied,<BR>
I promis'd my Lavinia for your bride:<BR>
Her from her plighted lord by force I took;<BR>
All ties of treaties, and of honor, broke:<BR>
On your account I wag'd an impious war-<BR>
With what success, 't is needless to declare;<BR>
I and my subjects feel, and you have had your share.<BR>
Twice vanquish'd while in bloody fields we strive,<BR>
Scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive:<BR>
The rolling flood runs warm with human gore;<BR>
The bones of Latians blanch the neighb'ring shore.<BR>
Why put I not an end to this debate,<BR>
Still unresolv'd, and still a slave to fate?<BR>
If Turnus' death a lasting peace can give,<BR>
Why should I not procure it whilst you live?<BR>
Should I to doubtful arms your youth betray,<BR>
What would my kinsmen the Rutulians say?<BR>
And, should you fall in fight, (which Heav'n defend!)<BR>
How curse the cause which hasten'd to his end<BR>
The daughter's lover and the father's friend?<BR>
Weigh in your mind the various chance of war;<BR>
Pity your parent's age, and ease his care."<BR>

Such balmy words he pour'd, but all in vain:<BR>
The proffer'd med'cine but provok'd the pain.<BR>
The wrathful youth, disdaining the relief,<BR>
With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief:<BR>
"The care, O best of fathers, which you take<BR>
For my concerns, at my desire forsake.<BR>
Permit me not to languish out my days,<BR>
But make the best exchange of life for praise.<BR>

The flying coward with an empty cloud."<BR>

"O Turnus, I adjure thee by these tears,<BR>
And whate'er price Amata's honor bears<BR>
Within thy breast, since thou art all my hope,<BR>
My sickly mind's repose, my sinking age's prop;<BR>
Since on the safety of thy life alone<BR>

Then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes,<BR>
Firm to his first intent, he thus replies:<BR>
"O mother, do not by your tears prepare<BR>
Such boding omens, and prejudge the war.<BR>
Resolv'd on fight, I am no longer free<BR>
To shun my death, if Heav'n my death decree."<BR>
Then turning to the herald, thus pursues:<BR>
"Go, greet the Trojan with ungrateful news;<BR>
Denounce from me, that, when to-morrow's light<BR>

In his Aetnaean forge, the God of Fire<BR>

A peaceful train they seem, in peace prepar'd for fight.<BR>

Of ev'ry Latian fair whom Jove misled<BR>
To mount by stealth my violated bed,<BR>

Peace leaves the violated fields, and hate<BR>
Both armies urges to their mutual fate.<BR>
With impious haste their altars are o'erturn'd,<BR>
The sacrifice half-broil'd, and half-unburn'd.<BR>
Thick storms of steel from either army fly,<BR>
And clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky;<BR>
Brands from the fire are missive weapons made,<BR>
With chargers, bowls, and all the priestly trade.<BR>
Latinus, frighted, hastens from the fray,<BR>
And bears his unregarded gods away.<BR>
These on their horses vault; those yoke the car;<BR>
The rest, with swords on high, run headlong to the war.<BR>

Messapus, eager to confound the peace,<BR>

Backward he fell; and, as his fate design'd,<BR>
The ruins of an altar were behind:<BR>
There, pitching on his shoulders and his head,<BR>
Amid the scatt'ring fires he lay supinely spread.<BR>
The beamy spear, descending from above,<BR>
His cuirass pierc'd, and thro' his body drove.<BR>

Greedy of spoils, th' Italians strip the dead<BR>

His bristly beard shines out with sudden fires;<BR>
The crackling crop a noisome scent expires.<BR>
Following the blow, he seiz'd his curling crown<BR>

He leaves behind a lane of slaughter'd foes.<BR>
These his lance reaches; over those he rolls<BR>
His rapid car, and crushes out their souls:<BR>
In vain the vanquish'd fly; the victor sends<BR>
The dead men's weapons at their living friends.<BR>
Thus, on the banks of Hebrus' freezing flood,<BR>

Clashing his sword against his brazen shield,<BR>

With fury not unlike, nor less disdain,<BR>
Exulting Turnus flies along the plain:<BR>
His smoking horses, at their utmost speed,<BR>
He lashes on, and urges o'er the dead.<BR>
Their fetlocks run with blood; and, when they bound,<BR>
The gore and gath'ring dust are dash'd around.<BR>
Thamyris and Pholus, masters of the war,<BR>
He kill'd at hand, but Sthenelus afar:<BR>

These eyes beheld Murranus bite the ground:<BR>
Mighty the man, and mighty was the wound.<BR>
I heard my dearest friend, with dying breath,<BR>
My name invoking to revenge his death.<BR>
Brave Ufens fell with honor on the place,<BR>
To shun the shameful sight of my disgrace.<BR>
On earth supine, a manly corpse he lies;<BR>
His vest and armor are the victor's prize.<BR>
Then, shall I see Laurentum in a flame,<BR>
Which only wanted, to complete my shame?<BR>
How will the Latins hoot their champion's flight!<BR>
How Drances will insult and point them to the sight!<BR>
Is death so hard to bear? Ye gods below,<BR>
(Since those above so small compassion show,)<BR>
Receive a soul unsullied yet with shame,<BR>
Which not belies my great forefather's name!"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He said; and while he spoke, with flying speed<BR>
Came Sages urging on his foamy steed:<BR>
Fix'd on his wounded face a shaft he bore,<BR>
And, seeking Turnus, sent his voice before:<BR>
"Turnus, on you, on you alone, depends<BR>
Our last relief: compassionate your friends!<BR>
Like lightning, fierce Aeneas, rolling on,<BR>
With arms invests, with flames invades the town:<BR>
The brands are toss'd on high; the winds conspire<BR>
To drive along the deluge of the fire.<BR>
All eyes are fix'd on you: your foes rejoice;<BR>
Ev'n the king staggers, and suspends his choice;<BR>
Doubts to deliver or defend the town,<BR>
Whom to reject, or whom to call his son.<BR>
The queen, on whom your utmost hopes were plac'd,<BR>
Herself suborning death, has breath'd her last.<BR>
'T is true, Messapus, fearless of his fate,<BR>
With fierce Atinas' aid, defends the gate:<BR>
On ev'ry side surrounded by the foe,<BR>
The more they kill, the greater numbers grow;<BR>
An iron harvest mounts, and still remains to mow.<BR>
You, far aloof from your forsaken bands,<BR>
Your rolling chariot drive o'er empty sands.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Stupid he sate, his eyes on earth declin'd,<BR>
And various cares revolving in his mind:<BR>
Rage, boiling from the bottom of his breast,<BR>
And sorrow mix'd with shame, his soul oppress'd;<BR>
And conscious worth lay lab'ring in his thought,<BR>
And love by jealousy to madness wrought.<BR>
By slow degrees his reason drove away<BR>
The mists of passion, and resum'd her sway.<BR>
Then, rising on his car, he turn'd his look,<BR>
And saw the town involv'd in fire and smoke.<BR>
A wooden tow'r with flames already blaz'd,<BR>
Which his own hands on beams and rafters rais'd;<BR>
And bridges laid above to join the space,<BR>
And wheels below to roll from place to place.<BR>
"Sister, the Fates have vanquish'd: let us go<BR>
The way which Heav'n and my hard fortune show.<BR>
The fight is fix'd; nor shall the branded name<BR>
Of a base coward blot your brother's fame.<BR>
Death is my choice; but suffer me to try<BR>
My force, and vent my rage before I die."<BR>
He said; and, leaping down without delay,<BR>
Thro' crowds of scatter'd foes he freed his way.<BR>
Striding he pass'd, impetuous as the wind,<BR>
And left the grieving goddess far behind.<BR>
As when a fragment, from a mountain torn<BR>
By raging tempests, or by torrents borne,<BR>
Or sapp'd by time, or loosen'd from the roots-<BR>
Prone thro' the void the rocky ruin shoots,<BR>
Rolling from crag to crag, from steep to steep;<BR>
Down sink, at once, the shepherds and their sheep:<BR>
Involv'd alike, they rush to nether ground;<BR>
Stunn'd with the shock they fall, and stunn'd from earth rebound:<BR>
So Turnus, hasting headlong to the town,<BR>
Should'ring and shoving, bore the squadrons down.<BR>
Still pressing onward, to the walls he drew,<BR>
Where shafts, and spears, and darts promiscuous flew,<BR>
And sanguine streams the slipp'ry ground embrue.<BR>
First stretching out his arm, in sign of peace,<BR>
He cries aloud, to make the combat cease:<BR>
"Rutulians, hold; and Latin troops, retire!<BR>
The fight is mine; and me the gods require.<BR>
'T is just that I should vindicate alone<BR>
The broken truce, or for the breach atone.<BR>
This day shall free from wars th' Ausonian state,<BR>
Or finish my misfortunes in my fate."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Both armies from their bloody work desist,<BR>
And, bearing backward, form a spacious list.<BR>
The Trojan hero, who receiv'd from fame<BR>
The welcome sound, and heard the champion's name,<BR>
Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls,<BR>
Greedy of war where greater glory calls.<BR>
He springs to fight, exulting in his force<BR>
His jointed armor rattles in the course.<BR>
Like Eryx, or like Athos, great he shows,<BR>
Or Father Apennine, when, white with snows,<BR>
His head divine obscure in clouds he hides,<BR>
And shakes the sounding forest on his sides.<BR>
The nations, overaw'd, surcease the fight;<BR>
Immovable their bodies, fix'd their sight.<BR>
Ev'n death stands still; nor from above they throw<BR>
Their darts, nor drive their batt'ring-rams below.<BR>
In silent order either army stands,<BR>
And drop their swords, unknowing, from their hands.<BR>
Th' Ausonian king beholds, with wond'ring sight,<BR>
Two mighty champions match'd in single fight,<BR>
Born under climes remote, and brought by fate,<BR>
With swords to try their titles to the state.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now, in clos'd field, each other from afar<BR>
They view; and, rushing on, begin the war.<BR>
They launch their spears; then hand to hand they meet;<BR>
The trembling soil resounds beneath their feet:<BR>
Their bucklers clash; thick blows descend from high,<BR>
And flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly.<BR>
Courage conspires with chance, and both ingage<BR>
With equal fortune yet, and mutual rage.<BR>
As when two bulls for their fair female fight<BR>
In Sila's shades, or on Taburnus' height;<BR>
With horns adverse they meet; the keeper flies;<BR>
Mute stands the herd; the heifers roll their eyes,<BR>
And wait th' event; which victor they shall bear,<BR>
And who shall be the lord, to rule the lusty year:<BR>
With rage of love the jealous rivals burn,<BR>
And push for push, and wound for wound return;<BR>
Their dewlaps gor'd, their sides are lav'd in blood;<BR>
Loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow thro' the wood:<BR>
Such was the combat in the listed ground;<BR>
So clash their swords, and so their shields resound.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Jove sets the beam; in either scale he lays<BR>
The champions' fate, and each exactly weighs.<BR>
On this side, life and lucky chance ascends;<BR>
Loaded with death, that other scale descends.<BR>
Rais'd on the stretch, young Turnus aims a blow<BR>
Full on the helm of his unguarded foe:<BR>
Shrill shouts and clamors ring on either side,<BR>
As hopes and fears their panting hearts divide.<BR>
But all in pieces flies the traitor sword,<BR>
And, in the middle stroke, deserts his lord.<BR>
Now is but death, or flight; disarm'd he flies,<BR>
When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies.<BR>
Fame says that Turnus, when his steeds he join'd,<BR>
Hurrying to war, disorder'd in his mind,<BR>
Snatch'd the first weapon which his haste could find.<BR>
'T was not the fated sword his father bore,<BR>
But that his charioteer Metiscus wore.<BR>
This, while the Trojans fled, the toughness held;<BR>
But, vain against the great Vulcanian shield,<BR>
The mortal-temper'd steel deceiv'd his hand:<BR>
The shiver'd fragments shone amid the sand.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Surpris'd with fear, he fled along the field,<BR>
And now forthright, and now in orbits wheel'd;<BR>
For here the Trojan troops the list surround,<BR>
And there the pass is clos'd with pools and marshy ground.<BR>
Aeneas hastens, tho' with heavier pace-<BR>
His wound, so newly knit, retards the chase,<BR>
And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse-<BR>
Yet, pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thus, when a fearful stag is clos'd around<BR>
With crimson toils, or in a river found,<BR>
High on the bank the deep-mouth'd hound appears,<BR>
Still opening, following still, where'er he steers;<BR>
The persecuted creature, to and fro,<BR>
Turns here and there, to scape his Umbrian foe:<BR>
Steep is th' ascent, and, if he gains the land,<BR>
The purple death is pitch'd along the strand.<BR>
His eager foe, determin'd to the chase,<BR>
Stretch'd at his length, gains ground at ev'ry pace;<BR>
Now to his beamy head he makes his way,<BR>
And now he holds, or thinks he holds, his prey:<BR>
Just at the pinch, the stag springs out with fear;<BR>
He bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with air:<BR>
The rocks, the lakes, the meadows ring with cries;<BR>
The mortal tumult mounts, and thunders in the skies.<BR>
Thus flies the Daunian prince, and, flying, blames<BR>
His tardy troops, and, calling by their names,<BR>
Demands his trusty sword. The Trojan threats<BR>
The realm with ruin, and their ancient seats<BR>
To lay in ashes, if they dare supply<BR>
With arms or aid his vanquish'd enemy:<BR>
Thus menacing, he still pursues the course,<BR>
With vigor, tho' diminish'd of his force.<BR>
Ten times already round the listed place<BR>
One chief had fled, and t' other giv'n the chase:<BR>
No trivial prize is play'd; for on the life<BR>
Or death of Turnus now depends the strife.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Within the space, an olive tree had stood,<BR>
A sacred shade, a venerable wood,<BR>
For vows to Faunus paid, the Latins' guardian god.<BR>
Here hung the vests, and tablets were ingrav'd,<BR>
Of sinking mariners from shipwrack sav'd.<BR>
With heedless hands the Trojans fell'd the tree,<BR>
To make the ground inclos'd for combat free.<BR>
Deep in the root, whether by fate, or chance,<BR>
Or erring haste, the Trojan drove his lance;<BR>
Then stoop'd, and tugg'd with force immense, to free<BR>
Th' incumber'd spear from the tenacious tree;<BR>
That, whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain,<BR>
His flying weapon might from far attain.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Confus'd with fear, bereft of human aid,<BR>
Then Turnus to the gods, and first to Faunus pray'd:<BR>
"O Faunus, pity! and thou Mother Earth,<BR>
Where I thy foster son receiv'd my birth,<BR>
Hold fast the steel! If my religious hand<BR>
Your plant has honor'd, which your foes profan'd,<BR>
Propitious hear my pious pray'r!" He said,<BR>
Nor with successless vows invok'd their aid.<BR>
Th' incumbent hero wrench'd, and pull'd, and strain'd;<BR>
But still the stubborn earth the steel detain'd.<BR>
Juturna took her time; and, while in vain<BR>
He strove, assum'd Meticus' form again,<BR>
And, in that imitated shape, restor'd<BR>
To the despairing prince his Daunian sword.<BR>
The Queen of Love, who, with disdain and grief,<BR>
Saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief,<BR>
T' assert her offspring with a greater deed,<BR>
From the tough root the ling'ring weapon freed.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Once more erect, the rival chiefs advance:<BR>
One trusts the sword, and one the pointed lance;<BR>
And both resolv'd alike to try their fatal chance.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Meantime imperial Jove to Juno spoke,<BR>
Who from a shining cloud beheld the shock:<BR>
"What new arrest, O Queen of Heav'n, is sent<BR>
To stop the Fates now lab'ring in th' event?<BR>
What farther hopes are left thee to pursue?<BR>
Divine Aeneas, (and thou know'st it too,)<BR>
Foredoom'd, to these celestial seats are due.<BR>
What more attempts for Turnus can be made,<BR>
That thus thou ling'rest in this lonely shade?<BR>
Is it becoming of the due respect<BR>
And awful honor of a god elect,<BR>
A wound unworthy of our state to feel,<BR>
Patient of human hands and earthly steel?<BR>
Or seems it just, the sister should restore<BR>
A second sword, when one was lost before,<BR>
And arm a conquer'd wretch against his conqueror?<BR>
For what, without thy knowledge and avow,<BR>
Nay more, thy dictate, durst Juturna do?<BR>
At last, in deference to my love, forbear<BR>
To lodge within thy soul this anxious care;<BR>
Reclin'd upon my breast, thy grief unload:<BR>
Who should relieve the goddess, but the god?<BR>
Now all things to their utmost issue tend,<BR>
Push'd by the Fates to their appointed<BR>
While leave was giv'n thee, and a lawful hour<BR>
For vengeance, wrath, and unresisted pow'r,<BR>
Toss'd on the seas, thou couldst thy foes distress,<BR>
And, driv'n ashore, with hostile arms oppress;<BR>
Deform the royal house; and, from the side<BR>
Of the just bridegroom, tear the plighted bride:<BR>
Now cease at my command." The Thund'rer said;<BR>
And, with dejected eyes, this answer Juno made:<BR>
"Because your dread decree too well I knew,<BR>
From Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew.<BR>
Else should you not behold me here, alone,<BR>
Involv'd in empty clouds, my friends bemoan,<BR>
But, girt with vengeful flames, in open sight<BR>
Engag'd against my foes in mortal fight.<BR>
'T is true, Juturna mingled in the strife<BR>
By my command, to save her brother's life-<BR>
At least to try; but, by the Stygian lake,<BR>
(The most religious oath the gods can take,)<BR>
With this restriction, not to bend the bow,<BR>
Or toss the spear, or trembling dart to throw.<BR>
And now, resign'd to your superior might,<BR>
And tir'd with fruitless toils, I loathe the fight.<BR>
This let me beg (and this no fates withstand)<BR>
Both for myself and for your father's land,<BR>
That, when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace,<BR>
(Which I, since you ordain, consent to bless,)<BR>
The laws of either nation be the same;<BR>
But let the Latins still retain their name,<BR>
Speak the same language which they spoke before,<BR>
Wear the same habits which their grandsires wore.<BR>
Call them not Trojans: perish the renown<BR>
And name of Troy, with that detested town.<BR>
Latium be Latium still; let Alba reign<BR>
And Rome's immortal majesty remain."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then thus the founder of mankind replies<BR>
(Unruffled was his front, serene his eyes)<BR>
"Can Saturn's issue, and heav'n's other heir,<BR>
Such endless anger in her bosom bear?<BR>
Be mistress, and your full desires obtain;<BR>
But quench the choler you foment in vain.<BR>
From ancient blood th' Ausonian people sprung,<BR>
Shall keep their name, their habit, and their tongue.<BR>
The Trojans to their customs shall be tied:<BR>
I will, myself, their common rites provide;<BR>
The natives shall command, the foreigners subside.<BR>
All shall be Latium; Troy without a name;<BR>
And her lost sons forget from whence they came.<BR>
From blood so mix'd, a pious race shall flow,<BR>
Equal to gods, excelling all below.<BR>
No nation more respect to you shall pay,<BR>
Or greater off'rings on your altars lay."<BR>
Juno consents, well pleas'd that her desires<BR>
Had found success, and from the cloud retires.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The peace thus made, the Thund'rer next prepares<BR>
To force the wat'ry goddess from the wars.<BR>
Deep in the dismal regions void of light,<BR>
Three daughters at a birth were born to Night:<BR>
These their brown mother, brooding on her care,<BR>
Indued with windy wings to flit in air,<BR>
With serpents girt alike, and crown'd with hissing hair.<BR>
In heav'n the Dirae call'd, and still at hand,<BR>
Before the throne of angry Jove they stand,<BR>
His ministers of wrath, and ready still<BR>
The minds of mortal men with fears to fill,<BR>
Whene'er the moody sire, to wreak his hate<BR>
On realms or towns deserving of their fate,<BR>
Hurls down diseases, death and deadly care,<BR>
And terrifies the guilty world with war.<BR>
One sister plague if these from heav'n he sent,<BR>
To fright Juturna with a dire portent.<BR>
The pest comes whirling down: by far more slow<BR>
Springs the swift arrow from the Parthian bow,<BR>
Or Cydon yew, when, traversing the skies,<BR>
And drench'd in pois'nous juice, the sure destruction flies.<BR>
With such a sudden and unseen a flight<BR>
Shot thro' the clouds the daughter of the night.<BR>
Soon as the field inclos'd she had in view,<BR>
And from afar her destin'd quarry knew,<BR>
Contracted, to the boding bird she turns,<BR>
Which haunts the ruin'd piles and hallow'd urns,<BR>
And beats about the tombs with nightly wings,<BR>
Where songs obscene on sepulchers she sings.<BR>
Thus lessen'd in her form, with frightful cries<BR>
The Fury round unhappy Turnus flies,<BR>
Flaps on his shield, and flutters o'er his eyes.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A lazy chillness crept along his blood;<BR>
Chok'd was his voice; his hair with horror stood.<BR>
Juturna from afar beheld her fly,<BR>
And knew th' ill omen, by her screaming cry<BR>
And stridor of her wings. Amaz'd with fear,<BR>
Her beauteous breast she beat, and rent her flowing hair.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Ah me!" she cries, "in this unequal strife<BR>
What can thy sister more to save thy life?<BR>
Weak as I am, can I, alas! contend<BR>
In arms with that inexorable fiend?<BR>
Now, now, I quit the field! forbear to fright<BR>
My tender soul, ye baleful birds of night;<BR>
The lashing of your wings I know too well,<BR>
The sounding flight, and fun'ral screams of hell!<BR>
These are the gifts you bring from haughty Jove,<BR>
The worthy recompense of ravish'd love!<BR>
Did he for this exempt my life from fate?<BR>
O hard conditions of immortal state,<BR>
Tho' born to death, not privileg'd to die,<BR>
But forc'd to bear impos'd eternity!<BR>
Take back your envious bribes, and let me go<BR>
Companion to my brother's ghost below!<BR>
The joys are vanish'd: nothing now remains,<BR>
Of life immortal, but immortal pains.<BR>
What earth will open her devouring womb,<BR>
To rest a weary goddess in the tomb!"<BR>
She drew a length of sighs; nor more she said,<BR>
But in her azure mantle wrapp'd her head,<BR>
Then plung'd into her stream, with deep despair,<BR>
And her last sobs came bubbling up in air.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now stern Aeneas his weighty spear<BR>
Against his foe, and thus upbraids his fear:<BR>
"What farther subterfuge can Turnus find?<BR>
What empty hopes are harbor'd in his mind?<BR>
'T is not thy swiftness can secure thy flight;<BR>
Not with their feet, but hands, the valiant fight.<BR>
Vary thy shape in thousand forms, and dare<BR>
What skill and courage can attempt in war;<BR>
Wish for the wings of winds, to mount the sky;<BR>
Or hid, within the hollow earth to lie!"<BR>
The champion shook his head, and made this short reply:<BR>
"No threats of thine my manly mind can move;<BR>
'T is hostile heav'n I dread, and partial Jove."<BR>
He said no more, but, with a sigh, repress'd<BR>
The mighty sorrow in his swelling breast.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then, as he roll'd his troubled eyes around,<BR>
An antique stone he saw, the common bound<BR>
Of neighb'ring fields, and barrier of the ground;<BR>
So vast, that twelve strong men of modern days<BR>
Th' enormous weight from earth could hardly raise.<BR>
He heav'd it at a lift, and, pois'd on high,<BR>
Ran stagg'ring on against his enemy,<BR>
But so disorder'd, that he scarcely knew<BR>
His way, or what unwieldly weight he threw.<BR>
His knocking knees are bent beneath the load,<BR>
And shiv'ring cold congeals his vital blood.<BR>
The stone drops from his arms, and, falling short<BR>
For want of vigor, mocks his vain effort.<BR>
And as, when heavy sleep has clos'd the sight,<BR>
The sickly fancy labors in the night;<BR>
We seem to run; and, destitute of force,<BR>
Our sinking limbs forsake us in the course:<BR>
In vain we heave for breath; in vain we cry;<BR>
The nerves, unbrac'd, their usual strength deny;<BR>
And on the tongue the falt'ring accents die:<BR>
So Turnus far'd; whatever means he tried,<BR>
All force of arms and points of art employ'd,<BR>
The Fury flew athwart, and made th' endeavor void.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A thousand various thoughts his soul confound;<BR>
He star'd about, nor aid nor issue found;<BR>
His own men stop the pass, and his own walls surround.<BR>
Once more he pauses, and looks out again,<BR>
And seeks the goddess charioteer in vain.<BR>
Trembling he views the thund'ring chief advance,<BR>
And brandishing aloft the deadly lance:<BR>
Amaz'd he cow'rs beneath his conqu'ring foe,<BR>
Forgets to ward, and waits the coming blow.<BR>
Astonish'd while he stands, and fix'd with fear,<BR>
Aim'd at his shield he sees th' impending spear.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The hero measur'd first, with narrow view,<BR>
The destin'd mark; and, rising as he threw,<BR>
With its full swing the fatal weapon flew.<BR>
Not with less rage the rattling thunder falls,<BR>
Or stones from batt'ring-engines break the walls:<BR>
Swift as a whirlwind, from an arm so strong,<BR>
The lance drove on, and bore the death along.<BR>
Naught could his sev'nfold shield the prince avail,<BR>
Nor aught, beneath his arms, the coat of mail:<BR>
It pierc'd thro' all, and with a grisly wound<BR>
Transfix'd his thigh, and doubled him to ground.<BR>
With groans the Latins rend the vaulted sky:<BR>
Woods, hills, and valleys, to the voice reply.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now low on earth the lofty chief is laid,<BR>
With eyes cast upward, and with arms display'd,<BR>
And, recreant, thus to the proud victor pray'd:<BR>
"I know my death deserv'd, nor hope to live:<BR>
Use what the gods and thy good fortune give.<BR>
Yet think, O think, if mercy may be shown-<BR>
Thou hadst a father once, and hast a son-<BR>
Pity my sire, now sinking to the grave;<BR>
And for Anchises' sake old Daunus save!<BR>
Or, if thy vow'd revenge pursue my death,<BR>
Give to my friends my body void of breath!<BR>
The Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life;<BR>
Thine is the conquest, thine the royal wife:<BR>
Against a yielded man, 't is mean ignoble strife."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
In deep suspense the Trojan seem'd to stand,<BR>
And, just prepar'd to strike, repress'd his hand.<BR>
He roll'd his eyes, and ev'ry moment felt<BR>
His manly soul with more compassion melt;<BR>
When, casting down a casual glance, he spied<BR>
The golden belt that glitter'd on his side,<BR>
The fatal spoils which haughty Turnus tore<BR>
From dying Pallas, and in triumph wore.<BR>
Then, rous'd anew to wrath, he loudly cries<BR>
(Flames, while he spoke, came flashing from his eyes)<BR>
"Traitor, dost thou, dost thou to grace pretend,<BR>
Clad, as thou art, in trophies of my friend?<BR>
To his sad soul a grateful off'ring go!<BR>
'T is Pallas, Pallas gives this deadly blow."<BR>
He rais'd his arm aloft, and, at the word,<BR>
Deep in his bosom drove the shining sword.<BR>
The streaming blood distain'd his arms around,<BR>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
